### CRYPT
### comes from the Greek word for “hidden.” To encrypt a
### message is to encode it—that is, to hide its meaning in code
### language. When a scientific term begins with crypto-, it always
### means that there's something hidden about it .

### crypt
### (1) A room completely or partly underground,
### especially under the main floor of a church. (2) A room or area in a
### large aboveground tomb.
### • His old nightmare was of being locked in a crypt with corpses as
### his only companions.
### Hidden under the main floor of a great church is often a large room,
### often with a tomb as its centerpiece. Many major European churches
### were built over the remains of a saint—the Vatican's great St. Peter's
### Basilica is an example—and instead of having the coffin buried, it
### was often given its spacious room below ground level. In a large
### aboveground tomb, or mausoleum, there may be several small
### chambers for individual coffins, also called crypts; when the comic
### book Tales from the Crypt made its first appearance in 1950, it was
### this meaning that the authors were referring to.

### encrypt
### (1) To convert into cipher. (2) To convert a
### message into code.
### • Messages on the group's Web site are encrypted in code words to
### keep law-enforcement agents from understanding them.
### Codes aren't always in another language; people have always been
### able to communicate in ways that conceal their real meaning. In
### countries ruled by dictators, novelists and playwrights have
### sometimes managed to encrypt their messages, conveying political
### ideas to their audiences so that the authorities never notice. But
### encryption today usually refers to a complex procedure performed
### on electronic text to make sure the wrong people—whether a
### nation's enemies or a business competitor (most businesses use
### encryption today)—can't read it. And sensitive data that merely
### resides on a company's own computers is often encrypted as well.

### cryptic
### (1) Mysterious; puzzlingly short. (2) Acting to hide
### or conceal.
### • From across the room, Louisa threw Philip a cryptic look, and he
### puzzled over what she was trying to tell him.
### Until the writing on the famous Rosetta Stone was finally translated
### in the early 19th century, Egyptian hieroglyphic writing was entirely
### cryptic, its meaning hidden from the modern world. In the same
### way, a cryptic comment is one whose meaning is unclear, and a
### cryptic note may leave you wondering. Cryptic coloring among plants
### and animals acts like camouflage; so, for example, some moths that
### are tasty to blue jays are cryptically colored to look like bugs that
### jays won't touch.

### cryptography
### (1) Secret writing. (2) The encoding
### and decoding of messages.
### • As a graduate student in mathematics, she never dreamed she
### would end up working in cryptography for the Defense Department.
### During World War II, cryptography became an extremely complex
### science for both the Allied and Axis powers. The Allies managed to
### secretly crack the code produced by the Nazis' Enigma machine, and
### thereby may have shortened the war by two years. The Axis
### cryptographers, on the other hand, never managed to crack the
### Americans' ultimate code—the spoken languages of the Navajo and
### other American Indians. In the age of computers, cryptography has
### become almost unbelievably complex; it's widely used in peacetime
### in such areas as banking telecommunications.

### AB/ABS
### comes to us from Latin, and means “from,” “away,” or “off.”
### Abuse is the use of something in the wrong way. To abduct is to
### “lead away from” or kidnap. Aberrant behavior is behavior that
### “wanders away from” what is acceptable. But there are so many
### words that include these roots that it would be absurd to try to list
### them all here.

### abscond
### To depart in secret and hide.
### • They discovered the next morning that their guest had absconded
### with most of the silverware during the night.
### Wagner's massive four-part opera The Ring of the Nibelung begins
### with a dwarf absconding with gold which he turns into a magic ring.
### And in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins absconds from
### Gollum's caves with the ring he has found, the ring Gollum calls “my
### precious”; what follows is detailed in the three-volume Lord of the
### Rings. (Tolkien knew Wagner's opera well.) A young couple might
### abscond from their parents to get married, but sooner or later they
### must face those parents again.

### abstemious
### Restrained,
### especially
### in
### the
### consumption of food or alcohol.
### • Her parents had left her two million dollars when they died, having
### been so abstemious for years that their neighbors all assumed they
### were poor.
### Many 14th-century monks lived by the Rule of St. Benedict, which
### demands an abstemious life of obedience and poverty. But not all
### monks could maintain such abstemious habits. Chaucer's Canterbury
### Tales contains a portrait of a fat monk who is supposed to follow a
### vegetarian diet but instead is an enthusiastic hunter who loves a
### juicy swan best. He justifies breaking the Rule by saying that it's old-
### fashioned and that he's just keeping up with modern times.
### Abstemious itself has a slightly old-fashioned sound today, especially
### in a country where everyone is constantly encouraged to consume.

### abstraction
### The consideration of a thing or idea
### without associating it with a particular example.
### • All the ideas she came up with in class were abstractions, since she
### had no experience of actual nursing at all.
### From its roots, abstraction should mean basically “something pulled
### or drawn away.” So abstract art is art that has moved away from
### painting objects of the ordinary physical world in order to show
### something beyond it. Theories are often abstractions; so a theory
### about economics, for instance, may “pull back” to take a broad view
### that somehow explains all of economics (but maybe doesn't end up
### explaining any of it very successfully). An abstract of a medical or
### scientific article is a one-paragraph summary of its contents—that is,
### the basic findings “pulled out” of the article.

### abstruse
### Hard to understand; deep or complex.
### • In every class he fills the blackboard with abstruse calculations,
### and we usually leave more confused than ever.
### The original meaning of abstruse, coming almost straight from the
### Latin, was “concealed, hidden.” It's easy to see how the word soon
### came to describe the kind of language used by those who possess
### certain kinds of expert knowledge (and don't necessarily want to
### share it with other people). Scientific writing is often filled with the
### kind of abstruse special vocabulary that's necessary for exact and
### precise descriptions. Unfortunately, the language of a science like
### quantum physics can make an already difficult subject even more
### abstruse to the average person.

### Answers

### PED-
### comes from the Greek word for “child.” The same root also
### has the meaning “foot” (see
### PED
### ), but in English words it usually
### isn't hard to tell the two apart.

### pedagogy
### The art, science, or profession of
### teaching.
### • His own pedagogy is extremely original; it sometimes alarms
### school officials but his students love it.
### Since in Greek agogos means “leader,” a paidagogos was a slave
### who led boys to school and back, but also taught them manners and
### tutored them after school. In time, pedagogue came to mean simply
### “teacher”; today the word has an old-fashioned ring to it, so it often
### means a stuffy, boring teacher. The word pedagogy, though, is still
### widely used, and often means simply “teaching.” And pedagogic
### training is what everyone majoring in education receives.

### pedant
### (1) A formal, unimaginative teacher. (2) A person
### who shows off his or her learning.
### • At one time or another, every student encounters a pedant who
### can make even the most interesting subject tedious.
### It isn't always easy to tell a pedantic teacher from one who is simply
### thorough. Some professors get an undeserved reputation for
### pedantry from students who just don't like the subject much.
### Regardless of that, a pedant need not be a teacher; anyone who
### goes around displaying his or her knowledge in a boring way can
### qualify.

### pediatrician
### A doctor who specializes in the
### diseases, development, and care of children.
### • Children in the U.S. usually see a pediatrician until they turn at
### least 15 or 16.
### Since iatros means “physician” in Greek (see
### IATR
### ), words such as
### pediatric naturally refer to “children's medicine.” Pediatrics is a fairly
### new medical specialty; until about 1900, children were considered
### small adults and given the same medical treatment, only milder.
### Benjamin Spock was the most famous pediatrician of the 20th
### century, and his book Baby and Child Care changed the way millions
### of Americans raised their children.

### encyclopedic
### (1) Of or relating to an
### encyclopedia. (2) Covering a wide range of subjects.
### • Someone with the kind of encyclopedic knowledge she has should
### be competing on Jeopardy.
### In Greek, paidaea meant not simply “child-rearing” but also
### “education,” and kyklios meant “general”; thus, an encyclopedia is a
### work broad enough to provide a kind of general education. The
### world's most eminent general encyclopedia, the Encyclopaedia
### Britannica, is a huge work that covers every field of human
### knowledge. But encyclopedic doesn't have to refer to books; it's
### often used to describe the wide-ranging knowledge that certain
### types of minds just can't stop acquiring.

### TROP
### comes from the Greek tropos, meaning “turn” or “change.”
### The troposphere is the level of the atmosphere where most weather
### changes—or “turns in the weather”—occur. And the Tropics of
### Cancer and Capricorn are the lines of latitude where the sun is
### directly
### overhead
### when
### it
### reaches
### its
### northernmost
### and
### southernmost points, on about June 22 and December 22 every year
### —that is, the point where it seems to turn and go back the other
### way.

### tropism
### Automatic movement by an organism unable
### to move about from place to place, especially a plant, that involves
### turning or growing toward or away from a stimulus.
### • The new president was soon showing a tropism for bold action, a
### tendency that seemed more the result of instinct than of careful
### thought.
### In hydrotropism, a plant's roots grow in the direction of increasing
### moisture, hoping to obtain water. In phototropism, a plant (or
### fungus) moves toward light, usually the sun—perhaps because, in
### the colder climates where such plants are usually found,
### concentrating the sun's warmth within the sun-seeking flower can
### create a warm and inviting environment for the insects that fertilize
### it. In thigmotropism, the organism moves in response to being
### touched; most climbing plants, for example, put out tiny tendrils that
### feel around for something solid and then attach themselves or curl
### around it. When microbiologists talk about tropism, however, they're
### often referring instead to the way a virus will seek out a particular
### type of cell to infect. And when intellectuals use the word, they
### usually mean a tendency shown by a person or group which they
### themselves might not even be aware of.

### entropy
### (1) The decomposition of the matter and
### energy in the universe to an ultimate state of inactive uniformity. (2)
### Chaos, randomness.
### • The apartment had been reduced to an advanced state of entropy,
### as if a tiny tornado had torn through it, shattering its contents and
### mixing the pieces together in a crazy soup.
### With its Greek prefix en-, meaning “within,” and the trop- root here
### meaning “change,” entropy basically means “change within (a closed
### system).” The closed system we usually think of when speaking of
### entropy (especially if we're not physicists) is the entire universe. But
### entropy applies to closed systems of any size. Entropy is seen when
### the ice in a glass of water in a warm room melts—that is, as the
### temperature of everything in the room evens out. In a slightly
### different type of entropy, a drop of food coloring in that glass of
### water soon spreads out evenly. However, when a nonphysicist uses
### the word, he or she is usually trying to describe a large-scale
### collapse.

### heliotrope
### Any of a genus of herbs or shrubs having
### small white or purple flowers.
### • A long bank of purple heliotrope lined the walkway, and her guests
### were always remarking on the flowers' glorious fragrance.
### Helios was the god of the sun in Greek mythology, and helio- came
### to appear in a number of sun-related English words. The genus
### known as the heliotropes consists of about 250 species; many are
### thought of as weeds, but the best-known species, garden heliotrope,
### is a popular and fragrant perennial that resembles the forget-me-
### not. The heliotrope tends to follow the sun—that is, turn its
### blossoms toward the sun as it travels from East to West every day.
### But the fact is, heliotropism—turning toward the sun—is common
### among flowers (and even leaves), and some, like the sunflower, are
### more dramatically heliotropic than the heliotrope. Those in the far
### North actually use their petals to reflect the sun's heat onto the
### flower's central ovary during the short growing season.

### psychotropic
### Acting on the mind.
### • My mother is taking two drugs that may produce psychotropic side
### effects, and I'm worried that they might be interacting.
### Psychotropic is used almost always to describe substances that we
### consume. Such substances are more numerous than you might
### think, and some have been known for thousands of years. Native
### American religions, for example, have used psychotropic substances
### derived from certain cactuses and mushrooms for centuries. Caffeine
### and nicotine can be called psychotropic. Psychotropic prescription
### drugs include antidepressants (such as Prozac) and tranquilizers
### (such as Valium). Any medication that blocks pain, from aspirin to
### the anesthetics used during surgery, can be considered a
### psychotropic drug. Even children are now prescribed psychotropic
### drugs, often to treat attention deficit disorder. And all recreational
### drugs are psychotropic. Psychoactive is a common synonym of
### psychotropic.

### NEO
### comes from the Greek neos, meaning “new.” Neo- has become
### a part of many English words. Some are easy to understand; for
### example, neo-Nazi. Some are less so; you might not immediately
### guess that neotropical means “from the tropics of the New World,”
### or that a neophyte is a “newcomer.” When William Ramsay
### discovered four new gases, he named them all using Greek roots
### that at first glance might sound slightly mysterious: argon (“idle”),
### krypton (“hidden”), xenon (“strange”)—and neon (“new”).

### neoclassic
### Relating to a revival or adaptation of the
### styles of ancient Greece and Roman, especially in music, art, or
### architecture.
### • He had always admired the paintings of the French neoclassical
### masters, especially Poussin and Ingres.
### In the arts and architecture, a style that has existed for a long time
### usually produces a reaction against it. So after the showy style of
### Europe's so-called baroque era (from about 1600 to the early
### 1700s), the reaction came in the form of the neoclassical movement,
### bringing order, restraint, and simpler and more conservative
### structures, whether in plays, sonatas, sculptures, or public buildings.
### Its inspiration was the art of ancient Greece and Rome—that is, of
### classical antiquity. Why classical? In Latin classicus meant “of the
### highest class,” so in English classic and classical originally described
### the best ancient Greek and Latin literature, but soon came to mean
### simply “of ancient Greek and Rome,” since these were already seen
### as the highest and best cultures. Neoclassic generally describes
### artworks from the 1700s or early 1800s (by the painter David, the
### composer Mozart, the sculptor Canova, etc.), but also works from
### the 20th century that seem to have been inspired by the ideals of
### Greece and Rome.

### Neolithic
### Of or relating to the latest period of the
### Stone Age, when polished stone tools were used.
### • Around the Mediterranean, the Neolithic period was a time of
### trade, of stock breeding, and of the first use of pottery.
### Since lithos in Greek means “stone,” the Neolithic period is the “new”
### or “late” period of the Stone Age, in contrast to the Paleolithic period
### (“old” or “early” period—see
### PALEO
### ) and the Mesolithic period
### (“middle” period) of the Stone Age. The use of polished stone tools
### came to different parts of the world at different times, but the
### Neolithic Age is usually said to begin around 9000 B.C. and to end
### around 3000 B.C., when the Bronze Age begins. The Neolithic is the
### era when the farming of plants and animals begins, and when, as a
### result, humans first begin to create permanent settlements.

### neoconservative
### A conservative who favors
### strongly encouraging democracy and the U.S. national interest in
### world affairs, including through military means.
### • Many believed that foreign policy in those years had fallen into the
### hands of the neoconservatives, and that the war in Iraq was one
### result.
### In the 1960s several well-known socialist intellectuals, including
### Norman Podhoretz and Irving Kristol, alarmed by growing political
### extremism on the left, began to move in the other direction. Soon
### the term neoconservative (or neocon for short) was being attached
### to them. Rather than simply drifting toward the political center,
### Podhoretz and Kristol actually moved far to the right, especially on
### the issue of maintaining a strong military stance toward the rest of
### the world. The main magazine of neoconservatism became
### Podhoretz's Commentary; it was later joined by the Weekly
### Standard, edited by Kristol's son William. Not everyone agrees on
### how to define these terms; still, it's clear that today you don't have
### to be a former liberal in order to be a neoconservative.

### neonatal
### Of or relating to babies in the first month
### after their birth.
### • The hospital's newest addition is a neonatal intensive-care unit,
### and newborns in critical condition are already being sent there from
### considerable distances.
### Partly based on the Latin natus, “born,” neonatal means “newly
### born.” Neonatal babies themselves are called neonates. Most
### hospitals now offer neonatal screening, which is used to detect
### diseases that are treatable only if identified during the first days of
### life, and specialized neonatal nursing as well. But despite spending
### much money on neonatal care, the U.S. still ranks lower than some
### much less wealthy countries (such as the Czech Republic, Portugal,
### and Cuba) in infant mortality (infant deaths).

### NOV
### comes from the Latin word novus, meaning “new.” To renovate
### an old house is to “make it new again”—that is, put it back in tip-top
### shape. The long-running PBS show Nova keeps its large audience up
### to date on what's new in the world of science. And when the British
### king sent Scottish settlers to a large island off Canada's Atlantic
### coast in the 17th century, he named it Nova Scotia, or “New
### Scotland.”

### novice
### (1) One who has no previous training or
### experience in a specific field or activity; beginner. (2) A new member
### of a religious order who is preparing to become a nun or monk.
### • It's hard to believe that a year ago she was a complete novice as a
### gardener, who couldn't identify a cornstalk.
### Among the ancient Romans, a novice (novicius) was usually a newly
### imported slave, who had to be trained in his or her duties. Among
### Catholics and Buddhists, if you desire to become a priest, monk, or
### nun, you must serve as a novice for a period of time, often a year
### (called your novitiate), before being ordained or fully professing your
### vows. No matter what kind of novice you are—at computers, at
### writing, at politics, etc.—you've got a lot to learn.

### novel
### (1) New and not resembling something formerly
### known or used. (2) Original and striking, especially in conception or
### style.
### • His techniques for dealing with these disturbed young people were
### novel, and they caught the attention of the institute's director.
### If someone tells you that you've come up with a novel idea or a
### novel interpretation of something, it's probably a compliment: not
### everyone is capable of original thinking. But not everything new is
### terribly worthwhile; a novelty, for example, is often a cute (or maybe
### just silly) little object that you might put on a display shelf in your
### house. It may seem surprising that the familiar noun novel is related
### as well. In the 14th century, Italian writers began writing collections
### of short tales, each of which they called a novella because it
### represented a new literary form; from this word, three centuries
### later, the English coined the noun novel.

### innovation
### (1) A new idea, device, or method. (2)
### The introduction of new ideas, devices, or methods.
### • “Smooshing” bits of candy into ice cream while the customer
### watched was just one of his innovations that later got copied by
### chains of ice-cream outlets.
### Innovation is a word that's almost always connected with business.
### In business today, it's almost a rule that a company that doesn't
### innovate is destined for failure. The most important and successful
### businesses were usually started by innovators. And company
### managers should always at least listen to the innovative ideas of
### their employees.

### supernova
### (1) The explosion of a star that causes
### it to become extremely bright. (2) Something that explodes into
### prominence or popularity.
### • After exploding, a nova leaves a “white dwarf” which may explode
### again in the future, but a supernova destroys the entire star.
### A nova, despite its name, isn't actually a “new” star, but rather one
### that wasn't noticed until it exploded, when it may increase in
### brightness by a million times before returning to its previous state a
### few days later. A supernova is far larger; a star in its supernova state
### may emit a billion times as much light as previously. After a few
### weeks it begins to dim, until it eventually ceases to exist; it's often
### replaced by a black hole. (Though remains that were shot out into
### space may survive; those of a great supernova seen in A.D. 1054 are
### now known as the Crab Nebula.) All this may serve as a warning to
### those human stars whose fame explodes too rapidly; supernovas of
### this kind have sometimes vanished by the following year.

### POS
### comes from the Latin verb ponere, meaning “to put” or “to
### place.” You expose film by “placing it out” in the light. You compose
### a song by “putting together” a series of notes. And you oppose
### locating a new prison in your town by “putting yourself against” it.

### impose
### (1) To establish or apply as a charge or penalty or
### in a forceful or harmful way. (2) To take unfair advantage.
### • After seeing her latest grades, her parents imposed new rules
### about how much time she had to spend on homework every night.
### The Latin imposui meant “put upon,” and that meaning carried over
### into English in impose. A CEO may impose a new manager on one of
### the company's plants. A state may impose new taxes on luxury items
### or cigarettes, and the federal government sometimes imposes trade
### restrictions on another country to punish it. A polite apology might
### begin with “I hope I'm not imposing on you” (that is, “forcing my
### presence on you”). And a self-imposed deadline is one that you
### decide to hold yourself to.

### juxtapose
### To place side by side.
### • You won't notice the difference between the original and the copy
### unless you juxtapose them.
### Since juxta means “near” in Latin, it's easy to see how juxtapose
### was formed. Juxtaposing is generally done for examination or effect.
### Interior designers constantly make decisions about juxtaposing
### objects and colors for the best effect. Juxtaposing two video clips
### showing the different things that a politician said about the same
### subject at two different times can be an effective means of
### criticizing. The juxtaposition of two similar X-rays can help medical
### students distinguish between two conditions that may be hard to tell
### apart. And advertisements frequently juxtapose “before” and “after”
### images to show a thrilling transformation.

### transpose
### (1) To change the position or order of (two
### things). (2) To move from one place or period to another.
### • She rechecked the phone number and discovered that two digits
### had been transposed.
### Though transposing two digits can be disastrous, transposing two
### letters in a word often doesn't matter too much. (You can prboalby
### raed tihs setnence witohut too mcuh toruble.) Transposing two
### words or sounds—as in “Can I sew you to another sheet?”—has
### been a good source of humor over the years. Doctors sometimes
### discover that something in the body—a nerve, an organ, etc.—has
### been transposed, or moved away from its proper place. For
### musicians, transposing means changing the key of a piece; if you
### can do this at a moment's notice, you've been well trained.

### superimpose
### To put or place one thing over
### something else.
### • Using transparent sheets, she superimposes territory boundaries
### on an outline of Africa, showing us how these changed in the late
### 19th and early 20th century.
### Superimposition was one of the magical effects employed by early
### filmmakers. Using “mirror shots,” with semitransparent mirrors set at
### 45° angles to the scene, they would superimpose shadowy images
### of ghosts or scenes from a character's past onto scenes from the
### present. Superimposing your own ideas on something, such as a
### historical event, has to be done carefully, since your ideas may

### , from the Latin verb tenere, basically means “hold” or “hold on
### to.” A tenant is the “holder” of an apartment, house, or land, but not
### necessarily the owner. A lieutenant governor may “hold the position”
### ( “serve in lieu”) of the governor when necessary.

### tenure
### (1) The amount of time that a person holds a job,
### office, or title. (2) The right to keep a job, especially the job of
### teacher or professor.
### • I know two assistant professors who are so worried about being
### denied tenure this year that they can't sleep.
### Tenure is about holding on to something, almost always a job or
### position. So you can speak of someone's 30-year tenure as
### chairman, or someone's brief tenure in the sales manager's office.
### But tenure means something slightly different in the academic world.
### In American colleges and universities, the best (or luckiest) teachers
### have traditionally been granted a lifetime appointment known as
### tenure after about six years of teaching. Almost nobody has as
### secure a job as a tenured professor, but getting tenure can be
### difficult, and most of them have earned it.

### tenacious
### Stubborn or determined in clinging to
### something.
### • He was known as a tenacious reporter who would stay with a story
### for months, risking his health and sometimes even his life.
### Success in most fields requires a tenacious spirit and a drive to
### achieve. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the entertainment
### business. Thousands of actors and actresses work tenaciously to
### build a TV or film career. But without talent or beauty, tenacity is
### rarely rewarded, and only a few become stars.

### tenable
### Capable of being held or defended; reasonable.
### • She was depressed for weeks after her professor said that her
### theory wasn't tenable.
### Tenable means “holdable.” In the past it was often used in a physical
### sense—for example, to refer to a city that an army was trying to
### “hold” militarily against an enemy force. But nowadays it's almost
### always used when speaking of “held” ideas and theories. If you hold
### an opinion but evidence appears that completely contradicts it, your
### opinion is no longer tenable. So, for example, the old ideas that
### cancer is infectious or that being bled by leeches can cure your
### whooping cough now seem untenable.

### tenet
### A widely held principle or belief, especially one held
### in common by members of a group or profession.
### • It was soon obvious that the new owners didn't share the tenets
### that the company's founders had held to all those years.
### A tenet is something we hold, but not with our hands. Tenets are
### often ideals, but also often statements of faith. Thus, we may speak
### of the tenets of Islam or Hinduism, the tenets of Western
### democracy, or the tenets of the scientific method, and in each case
### these tenets may combine elements of both faith and ideals.

## Number Words
### MONO
### comes from the Greek monos, meaning “along” or “single.”
### So a monorail is a railroad that has only one rail; a monocle is an
### old-fashioned eyeglass that a gentleman used to squeeze into his
### eye socket; a monotonous voice seems to have only one tone; and a
### monopoly puts all ownership of a type of product or service in the
### hands of a single company.

### monogamous
### Being married to one person or
### having one mate at a time.
### • Geese, swans, and most other birds are monogamous and mate
### for life.
### American marriage is by law monogamous; people are permitted to
### have only one spouse (husband or wife) at a time. There are
### cultures with laws that permit marriage to more than one person at
### a time, or polygamy. Some Islamic countries permit polygamy, as do
### some African tribes. In this country the Mormons were polygamous
### until 1890, when they were forced to adopt monogamy by the
### unsympathetic federal government.

### monoculture
### (1) The cultivation of a single crop
### to the exclusion of other uses of land. (2) A culture dominated by a
### single element.
### • Monoculture is practiced on a vast scale in the American Midwest,
### where nothing but corn can be seen in the fields for hundreds of
### square miles.
### The Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49, which led to the deaths of over
### a million people, resulted from the monoculture of potatoes, which
### were destroyed by a terrible blight, leaving farmers nothing else to
### eat. Almost every traditional farming society has practiced crop
### rotation, the planting of different crops on a given piece of land from
### year to year, so as to keep the soil from losing its quality. But in the
### modern world, monoculture has become the rule on the largest
### commercial farms, where the same crop can be planted year after
### year by means of the intensive use of fertilizers. Modern
### monoculture has produced huge crops; on a large scale, it permits
### great efficiency in planting, pest control, and harvesting. But many
### experts believe this all comes at a huge cost to the environment.

### monolithic
### (1) Appearing to be a huge, featureless,
### often rigid whole. (2) Made up of material with no joints or seams.
### • The sheer monolithic rock face of Yosemite's El Capitan looks
### impossible to climb, but its cracks and seams are enough for
### experienced rock climbers.
### The -lith in monolith comes from the Greek lithos, “stone,” so
### monolith in its original sense means a huge stone like those at
### Stonehenge. What's so impressive about monoliths is that they have
### no separate parts or pieces. To the lone individual, any huge
### institution or government bureaucracy can seem monolithic. But the
### truth may be different: The former U.S.S.R. once seemed monolithic
### and indestructible to the West, but in the 1990s it crumbled into a
### number of independent republics.

### monotheism
### The worship of a single god.
### • Christian monotheism finally triumphed in the Roman Empire in
### A.D. 392, when the worship of pagan gods and goddesses was
### forbidden.
### The monotheism of the ancient Hebrews had to combat the
### polytheism (worship of many gods) of the surrounding peoples from
### the earliest times. As the Bible relates, several times in their history
### the Hebrews turned away from their monotheistic beliefs and
### accepted foreign gods, such as those imported by King Solomon.
### Each time their own God would punish them for their disloyalty, and
### the people of Israel would return to monotheism. Today Judaism
### shares its monotheism with two much larger religions, Christianity
### and Islam.

### UNI
### comes from the Latin word for “one.” A uniform is a single
### design worn by everyone. A united group has one single opinion, or
### forms a single unit. A unitard is a one-piece combination leotard and
### tights, very good for skating, skiing, dancing—or riding a one-
### wheeled unicycle.

### unicameral
### Having
### only one
### lawmaking
### chamber.
### • In China, with its unicameral system of government, a single group
### of legislators meets to make the laws.
### Unicameral means “one-chambered,” and the term almost always
### describes a governing body. Our federal legislature, like those of
### most democracies, is bicameral, with two legislative (lawmaking)
### bodies—the Senate and the House of Representatives. And except
### for Nebraska, all the state legislatures are also bicameral. So why did
### the nation decide on a bicameral system? Partly in order to keep
### some power out of the hands of ordinary voters, who the Founding
### Fathers didn't completely trust. For that reason, the original
### Constitution states that senators are to be elected by the state
### legislatures; not until 1914, after passage of a Constitutional
### amendment, did we first cast direct votes for our senators.

### unilateral
### (1) Done by one person or party; one-
### sided. (2) Affecting one side of the body.
### • The Japanese Constitution of 1947 includes a unilateral rejection of
### warfare as an option for their country.
### The world is a smaller place than it used to be, and we get
### uncomfortable when a single nation adopts a policy of unilateralism
### —that is, acting independently with little regard for what the rest of
### the world thinks. A unilateral invasion of another country, for
### instance, usually looks like a grab for power and resources. But
### occasionally the world welcomes a unilateral action, as when the
### U.S. announced unilateral nuclear-arms reductions in the early
### 1990s. Previously, such reductions had only happened as part of
### bilateral (“two-sided”) agreements with the old Soviet Union.
### Multilateral agreements, on issues such as climate change, often
### involve most of the world's nations.

### unison
### (1) Perfect agreement. (2) Sameness of
### musical pitch.
### • Unable to read music well enough to harmonize, the village choir
### sang only in unison.
### This word usually appears in the phrase “in unison,” which means
### “together, at the same time” or “at the same musical pitch.” So an
### excited crowd responding to a speaker may shout in unison, and a
### group of demonstrators may chant in unison. The old church music
### called Gregorian chant was written to be sung in unison, with no
### harmonizing voices, and kindergarten kids always sing in unison (at
### least when they can all find the same pitch). In a similar way, an
### aerobics class moves in unison following the instructor, and a group
### or even a whole town may work in unison when everyone agrees on
### a common goal.

### unitarian
### Relating or belonging to a religious
### group that believes that God exists only in one person and stresses
### individual freedom of belief.
### • With his unitarian tendencies, he wasn't likely to get into fights
### over religious beliefs.
### Unitarianism, originally a sect of Christianity believing in a single or
### unitary God, grew up in 18th-century England and developed in
### America in the early 19th century. Though they believe in Christ's
### teaching, they reject the idea of the three-part Trinity—God as
### father, son, and holy spirit—and thus deny that Christ was divine, so
### some people don't consider them truly Christian. In this century the
### Unitarians joined with the Universalist Church, a movement founded
### on a belief in universal salvation—that is, the saving of every soul
### from damnation after death. Both have always been liberal and fairly
### small; today they count about half a million members. Without a
### capital letter, unitarian refers simply to belief in a unitary God, or in
### unity within some nonreligious system.
