### CANT
### , from the Latin verb cantare, meaning “sing,” produces
### several words that come directly from Latin. But some others came
### to English by way of French, which added an h to the root, giving us
### such words as chant and chantey.

### cantata
### A musical composition, particularly a religious
### work from the 17th or 18th century, for one or more voices
### accompanied by instruments.
### • Composers of the 18th century composed sacred cantatas by the
### dozen, and Bach's friend G. P. Telemann actually wrote over a
### thousand.
### A cantata is sung, unlike a sonata, which is played on instruments
### only. The most famous cantatas are by Johann Sebastian Bach, who
### wrote the music for about 200 religious cantatas, using hymns and
### new religious poems as his texts. His cantatas consisted of several
### different sections for different voices—solos, duets, and choruses.
### Some of his nonreligious cantatas have been performed like mini-
### operas.

### incantation
### (1) A use of spells or verbal charms
### spoken or sung as part of a ritual of magic. (2) A formula of words
### used in, or as if in, such a ritual.
### • He repeated the words slowly over and over like an incantation.
### Incantation comes directly from the Latin word incantare, “enchant.”
### Incantare itself has cantare as a root, which reminds us that magic
### and ritual have always been associated with chanting and music.
### Incantations have often been in strange languages; “Abracadabra” is
### a not-so-serious version of an incantation.

### cantor
### An official of a Jewish synagogue who sings or
### chants the music of the services and leads the congregation in
### prayer.
### • The congregation waited for the cantor to begin the prayers before
### joining in.
### The cantor is, after the rabbi, the most important figure in a Jewish
### worship service. A cantor not only must possess an excellent singing
### voice but also must know by heart long passages of Hebrew. Cantors
### such as Jan Peerce and Richard Tucker became international opera
### stars. The comedian and singer Edward Israel Iskowitz renamed
### himself Eddie Cantor for his original profession and became
### enormously popular on stage, screen, radio, and television for over
### 40 years.

### descant
### An additional melody sung above the principal
### melody.
### • The soprano added a soaring descant to the final chorus that held
### the listeners spellbound.
### The prefix des-, meaning “two” or “apart,” indicates that the descant
### is a “second song” apart from the main melody. In popular songs a
### descant will often be sung at the very end to produce a thrilling
### climax.

### LINGU
### comes from the Latin word that means both “tongue” and
### “language,” and in English today tongue can still mean “language”
### (as in “her native tongue”). Our expression “slip of the tongue” is
### just a translation of the Latin phrase lapsus linguae. The root even
### shows up in a slangy-sounding word like lingo. And since lingu-
### changed to langu- in French, our word language is related as well.

### linguistics
### The study of human speech.
### • The new speechwriter, who had majored in linguistics, was soon
### putting his knowledge of the deceptive tricks of language to good
### use.
### Any analysis of language, including 8th-grade grammar, can be
### called linguistics. As recently as 200 years ago, ordinary grammar
### was about the only kind of linguistics there was. Today a linguist
### may be a person who learns foreign languages, but the term usually
### refers to people who devote themselves to analyzing the structure of
### language. Many linguists concentrate on the history of a language;
### others study the way children learn to speak; others analyze the
### sounds of a language—and still others just study English grammar, a
### subject so big that you could easily spend your entire life on it.

### multilingual
### Using or able to use several
### languages.
### • She soon discovered that he was truly multilingual, fluent in not
### only the German and Polish he had grown up speaking but in English
### and Arabic as well.
### The roots of multilingual come from Latin (see
### MULTI
### ). If you
### happen to prefer Greek, use the synonym polyglot, in which poly-
### has the same meaning as multi-, and -glot means the same thing as
### -lingual. The best way to become multilingual is probably to be born
### in a bilingual (two-language) household; learning those first two
### seems to give the mind the kind of exercise that makes later
### language-learning easy.

### lingua franca
### A language used as a common or
### commercial language among peoples who speak different languages.
### • That first evening in Tokyo, she heard English being spoken at the
### next table, and realized it was serving as a lingua franca for a party
### of Korean and Japanese businessmen.
### In the Middle Ages, the Arabs of the eastern Mediterranean referred
### to all Europeans as Franks (the name of the tribe that once occupied
### the land we call France). Since there was plenty of Arab-European
### trade, the traders in the Mediterranean ports eventually developed a
### trading language combining Italian, Arabic, and other languages,
### which almost everyone could more or less understand, and it
### became known as the “Frankish language,” or lingua franca. Some
### languages actually succeed in becoming lingua francas without
### changing much. So, when the Roman empire became vast and
### mighty, Latin became the important lingua franca; and at a meeting
### between Japanese and Vietnamese businesspeople today, English
### may well be the only language spoken.

### linguine
### A narrow, flat pasta.
### • As a test of her clients' table manners, she would serve them
### challenging dishes and watch to see how gracefully they could
### handle chopsticks or deal with long, slithery linguine.
### The modern language closest to Latin is Italian, and the Italian word
### linguine means literally “little tongues.” Linguine is only one of the
### types of pasta whose names describes their shapes. Others include
### spaghetti (“little strings”), fettuccine (“little ribbons”), penne (“little
### quills”), orzo (“barley”), farfalle (“butterflies”), vermicelli (“little
### worms”), capellini (“little hairs”), fusilli (“little spindles”), and
### radiatori (“little radiators”). If you're thinking about learning Italian,
### you could make a good start by just visiting an Italian restaurant.

### Answers

### SPIR
### comes from the Latin words meaning “breath” and “breathe.”
### When we inspire others—that is, give them inspiration—it's as
### though we're breathing new energy and imagination into them.
### When you expire, or die, you “breathe out” your soul in your last
### breath. A license, membership, credit card, or free offer may also
### expire, at a time indicated by its expiration date.

### spirited
### Full of energy or courage; very lively or
### determined.
### • The team put up a spirited defense, but they were doomed from
### the start.
### You may see spirited used to describe a conversation, a debate, a
### horse, or a campaign. And it often shows up in such words as high-
### spirited (“bold and energetic”), mean-spirited (“spiteful”), and
### public-spirited (“generous to a community”), all of which reflect the
### original meaning of spirit, a notion much like “soul” or “personality.”

### dispiriting
### Causing a loss of hope or enthusiasm.
### • It was terribly dispiriting for them to lose yet another game, and
### he had to reassure his daughter that she'd actually done a great job
### as goalie.
### Lots of things can be dispiriting: a bad job interview, an awful film, a
### relationship going sour. Maybe for that reason, dispiriting has lots of
### synonyms: discouraging, disheartening, demoralizing, depressing,
### etc.

### respirator
### (1) A device worn over the nose and
### mouth to filter out dangerous substances from the air. (2) A device
### for maintaining artificial respiration.
### • His lungs had been terribly damaged by decades of heavy
### smoking, and he'd been living on a respirator for the last year.
### Respiration means simply “breathing.” We usually come across the
### word in artificial respiration, the lifesaving technique in which you
### force air into the lungs of someone who's stopped breathing.
### Respirators can take several different forms. Scuba-diving equipment
### always includes a respirator, though it doesn't actually do the
### breathing for the diver. Medical respirators, which are used especially
### for babies and for emergency care and actually take over the job of
### getting oxygen into the lungs, are today usually called ventilators, so
### as to distinguish them from simple oxygen systems (which merely
### provide a steady flow of oxygen into the nostrils) and face masks.

### transpire
### (1) To happen. (2) To become known.
### • We kept up our questioning, and it soon transpired that the boys
### had known about the murder all along .
### Since the prefix trans- means “through” (see
### TRANS
### ), transpire's
### most literal meaning is something like “breathe through.” Thus, the
### original meaning of the English word—still used today—is to give off
### a watery vapor through a surface such as a leaf. From there, it came
### to mean also the gradual appearance of previously secret
### information, as if leaking out of the pores of a leaf (as in “It
### transpired that she was not only his employee but also his
### girlfriend”). And soon it was being used to mean simply “happen”
### (as in “I wondered what had transpired in the cafeteria at
### lunchtime”).

### VER
### comes from the Latin word for “truth.” A verdict in a trial is “the
### truth spoken” (see
### DICT
### ). But a just verdict may depend on the
### veracity, or “truthfulness,” of the witnesses.

### verify
### (1) To prove to be true or correct. (2) To check or
### test the accuracy of.
### • It is the bank teller's job to verify the signature on a check.
### During talks between the United States and the former Soviet Union
### on nuclear weapons reduction, one big problem was how to verify
### that weapons had been eliminated. Since neither side wanted the
### other to know its secrets, verification of the facts became a difficult
### issue. Because of the distrust on both sides, many doubted that the
### real numbers would ever be verifiable.

### aver
### To state positively as true; declare.
### • The defendant averred that she was nowhere near the scene of
### the crime on the night in question.
### Since aver contains the “truth” root, it basically means “confirm as
### true.” You may aver anything that you're sure of. In legal situations,
### aver means to state positively as a fact; thus, Perry Mason's clients
### aver that they are innocent, while the district attorney avers the
### opposite. If you make such a statement while under oath, and it
### turns out that you lied, you may have committed the crime of
### perjury.

### verisimilitude
### (1) The appearance of being
### true or probable. (2) The depiction of realism in art or literature.
### • By the beginning of the 20th century, the leading European
### painters were losing interest in verisimilitude and beginning to
### experiment with abstraction.
### From its roots, verisimilitude means basically “similarity to the truth.”
### Most fiction writers and filmmakers aim at some kind of
### verisimilitude to give their stories an air of reality. They need not
### show something actually true, or even very common, but simply
### something believable. A mass of good details in a play, novel,
### painting, or film may add verisimilitude. A spy novel without some
### verisimilitude won't interest many readers, but a fantastical novel
### may not even attempt to seem true to life.

### veracity
### (1) Truth or accuracy. (2) The quality of
### being truthful or honest.
### • We haven't been able to check the veracity of most of his story,
### but we know he wasn't at the motel that night.
### People often claim that a frog placed in cold water that then is
### gradually heated will let itself be boiled to death, but the story
### actually lacks veracity. We often hear that the Eskimo (Inuit) peoples
### have dozens of words for “snow,” but the veracity of the statement is
### doubtful, since Eskimo languages seem to have no more snow words
### than English (with flake, blizzard, powder, drift, freezing rain, etc.).
### In 2009 millions accepted the veracity of the claim that, against all
### the evidence, the elected president wasn't a native-born American.
### Not all the “facts” we accept without thinking are harmless.

### Answers

### TURB
### comes from the Latin verb turbare, “to throw into confusion
### or upset,” and the noun turba, “crowd” or “confusion.” So a
### disturbance, for example, confuses and upsets normal order or
### routine.

### turbid
### (1) Thick or murky, especially with churned-up
### sediment. (2) Unclear, confused, muddled.
### • The mood of the crowd was restless and turbid, and any spark
### could have turned them into a mob.
### The Colorado River in spring, swollen by melting snow from the high
### mountains, races through the Grand Canyon, turbid and churning. A
### chemical solution may be described as turbid rather than clear. And
### your emotions may be turbid as well, especially where love is
### involved: What did he mean by that glance? Why did she say it like
### that?

### perturb
### To upset, confuse, or disarrange.
### • News of the new peace accord was enough to perturb some radical
### opponents of any settlements.
### With its per- prefix, perturb meant originally “thoroughly upset,”
### though today the word has lost most of its intense edge. Perturb and
### perturbation are often used by scientists, usually when speaking of a
### change in their data indicating that something has affected some
### normal process. When someone is referred to as imperturbable, it
### means he or she manages to remain calm through the most trying
### experiences.

### turbine
### A rotary engine with blades made to turn and
### generate power by a current of water, steam, or air under pressure.
### • The power plant used huge turbines powered by water going over
### the dam to generate electricity.
### The oldest and simplest form of turbine is the waterwheel, which is
### made to rotate by water falling across its blades and into buckets
### suspended from them. Hero of Alexandria invented the first steam-
### driven turbine in the 1st century A.D., but a commercially practical
### steam turbine wasn't developed until 1884; steam turbines are now
### the main elements of electric power stations. Jet engines are gas
### turbines. A turbojet engine uses a turbine to compress the incoming
### air that feeds the engine before being ejected to push the plane
### forward; a turboprop engine uses its exhaust to drive a turbine that
### spins a propeller. A wind turbine generates electricity by being
### turned by the wind; the largest now have vanes with a turning
### diameter of over 400 feet.

### turbulent
### (1) Stirred up, agitated. (2) Stirring up
### unrest, violence, or disturbance.
### • The huge ocean liner Queen Elizabeth II was never much troubled
### by turbulent seas that might have sunk smaller boats.
### Some people lead turbulent lives, and some are constantly in the
### grip of turbulent emotions. The late 1960s are remembered as
### turbulent years of social revolution in America and Europe. Often the
### captain of an airplane will warn passengers to fasten their seatbelts
### because of upper-air turbulence, which can make for a bumpy ride.
### El Niño, a seasonal current of warm water in the Pacific Ocean, may
### create turbulence in the winds across the United States, affecting
### patterns of rainfall and temperature as well.

### VOLU/VOLV
### comes from the Latin verb volvere, meaning “to roll,
### wind, turn around, or twist around.” Thus, revolve simply means
### “turn in circles.” And a volume was originally a scroll or roll of
### papyrus.

### voluble
### Speaking readily and rapidly; talkative.
### • He proved to be a voluble informer who would tell stories of
### bookies, smugglers, and hit men to the detectives for hours.
### A voluble person has words “rolling” off his or her tongue. In O.
### Henry's famous story “The Ransom of Red Chief,” the kidnappers
### nab a boy who turns out to be so unbearably voluble that they can
### hardly wait to turn him loose again.

### devolve
### ((1) To pass (responsibility, power, etc.) from one
### person or group to another person or group at a lower level of
### authority. (2) To gradually go from an advanced state to a less
### advanced state.
### • Since 1998, considerable power has been devolving from the
### British government in London to the new Scottish Parliament in
### Edinburgh.
### With its de- prefix (see
### DE
### ), devolution implies moving backward.
### Once powers have been centralized in a unified government, giving
### any powers back—that is, devolving the power—to a smaller
### governmental unit can seem to be reversing a natural development.
### In a somewhat similar way, a job that your boss doesn't want to do
### may devolve upon you. But devolve and devolution are also treated
### nowadays as the opposites of evolve and evolution. So we may also
### speak of moral devolution, such as occurred in Germany in the
### 1930s, when a country with an extraordinary culture became a
### brutal dictatorship. And parents may watch their slacker teenager
### and wonder if devolution is occurring right in front of their eyes.

### evolution
### A process of change from a lower,
### simpler, or worse state to one that is higher, more complex, or
### better.
### • Thomas Jefferson and the other Founding Fathers believed that
### political evolution reached its highest form in democracy.
### Part of the humor of the old Flintstones cartoon show is that it
### contradicts what is known about biological evolution, since humans
### actually evolved long after dinosaurs were extinct. Evolution can also
### be used more broadly to refer to technology, society, and other
### human creations. For example, an idea may evolve, even in your
### own mind, as the months or years pass. And though many people
### don't believe that human beings truly become better with the
### passing centuries, many will argue that our societies tend to evolve,
### producing more goods and providing more protection for more
### people.

### convoluted
### (1) Having a pattern of curved
### windings. (2) Involved, intricate.
### • After 10 minutes, Mr. Collins's strange story had become so
### convoluted that none of us could follow it.
### Convolution originally meant a complex winding pattern such as
### those visible on the surface of the brain. So a convoluted argument
### or a convoluted explanation is one that winds this way and that. An
### official document may have to wind its way through a convoluted
### process and be stamped by eight people before being approved.
### Convoluted language makes many people suspicious; as a great
### philosopher once said, “Anything that can be said can be said
### clearly.”

### FAC
### comes from the Latin verb facere, meaning “to make or do.”
### Thus, a fact was originally simply “something done.” A benefactor is
### someone who does good. And to manufacture is to make, usually in
### a factory.

### factor
### Something that contributes to producing a result:
### ingredient.
### • The most important factor in the success of the treaty talks was
### the physical presence of the two presidents.
### In Latin factor means simply “doer.” So in English a factor is an
### “actor” or element or ingredient in some situation or quantity. Charm
### can be a factor in someone's success, and lack of exercise can be a
### factor in producing a poor physique. In math we use factor to mean
### a number that can be multiplied or divided to produce a given
### number (for example, 5 and 8 are factors of 40). And in biology a
### gene may be called a factor, since genes are ingredients in the total
### organism.

### factotum
### A person whose job involves doing many
### different kinds of work.
### • Over the years she had become the office factotum, who might be
### doing legal research one day and organizing the company picnic the
### next.
### This odd word doesn't come from ancient Latin, but it was coined to
### look as if it did. The term Johannes factotum, meaning “Jack-of-all-
### trades,” first shows up in writing in 1592 to describe none other than
### Shakespeare himself. The word gofer is similar to factotum but a bit
### less dignified. In other words, a factotum is an assistant, but one
### who may have taken over some fairly important functions.

### facile
### (1) Easily accomplished. (2) Shallow, superficial.
### • The principal made a facile argument for the school's policy, but no
### one was convinced.
### A facile suggestion doesn't deal with the issue in any depth, and a
### facile solution may be only temporarily effective. A facile writer is
### one who seems to write too quickly and easily, and a careful reader
### may discover that the writer hasn't really said very much.

### facilitate
### To make (something) easier; to make
### (something) run more smoothly.
### • Her uncle hadn't exactly gotten her the job, but he had certainly
### facilitated the process.
### Facilitating is about getting things done. Clever employees are
### quietly facilitating all kinds of useful activity within their
### organizations all the time. People who lead therapy groups or
### workshops are often called facilitators, since their job isn't to teach
### or to order but rather to make the meetings as productive as
### possible. Even businesses now use facilitators in meetings where
### they don't want any person's particular desires to outweigh anyone
### else's. The facilitation of a rewarding discussion should be a
### facilitator's only goal. Today, in recognition of the many different
### situations that may call for a facilitator, there is even an International
### Association of Facilitators.

### LUM
### comes from the Latin noun lumen, meaning “light.” Thus, our
### word illuminate means “to supply with light” or “make clear,” and
### illumination is light that shines on something.

### lumen
### In physics, the standard unit for measuring the
### rate of the flow of light.
### • The lumen is a measure of the perceived power of light.
### There are two common units for measuring light, the candela and
### the lumen. Both are recognized as standard international units,
### which also include the second (for time), the kilogram (for weight),
### and the meter (for length). The candela is a measure of intensity; an
### ordinary candle gives off light with the intensity of about one
### candela. The lumen is a measure of “luminous flux”; a standard 100-
### watt lightbulb gives off 1500–1700 lumens. Luminous flux indicates
### how much light is actually perceived by the human eye.
### Technologies vary in how efficiently they turn electricity into light;
### halogen lights produce about 12 lumens per watt, ordinary
### incandescent lightbulbs produce about 15 lumens per watt, and
### compact fluorescent bulbs produce about 50 lumens per watt.

### luminous
### (1) Producing or seeming to produce light.
### (2) Filled with light.
### • She ended her recital with a luminous performance of Ravel's song
### cycle, and the crowd called her back for repeated encores.
### Luminous, like its synonyms radiant, shining, glowing, and lustrous,
### is generally a positive adjective, especially when it describes
### something that doesn't literally glow, such as a face, a performance,
### or a poem. Luminous signs depend on a gas such as neon, krypton,
### argon, xenon, or radon—and you can use luminous (DayGlo) paint to
### make your own signs. New technologies have now given us luminous
### fabrics, which are being used to produce striking or creepy effects in
### clothing, upholstery, and interior surfaces.

### bioluminescent
### Relating to light given off
### by living organisms.
### • Most of the light emitted by bioluminescent marine organisms is
### blue or blue-green.
### Bio- comes from the Greek word for “life” (see
### BIO
### ). On land,
### fireflies, glowworms, and the fox-fire fungus are all known for their
### bioluminescence. In the sea, bioluminescent life-forms include
### plankton, squid, and comb jellies, as well as some unusual fish. Most
### deep-sea animals are bioluminescent, but single-celled algae living
### at or near the surface can also create a remarkable show, as they
### often do in Bioluminescent Bay on the Puerto Rican island of
### Vieques. But bioluminescence is unknown in true plants, and
### mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians never got the knack of it
### either.

### luminary
### A very famous or distinguished person.
### • Entering the glittering reception room, she immediately spotted
### several luminaries of the art world.
### The Latin word luminaria could mean either “lamps” or “heavenly
### bodies.” For medieval astrologers, the luminaries were the sun and
### the moon, the brightest objects in the heavens. Today a luminary is
### usually a person of “brilliant” achievement: a celebrity, a “leading
### light,” or a “star.”

## Words from Mythology and History
### muse
### A source of inspiration; a guiding spirit.
### • At 8:00 each morning he sat down at his desk and summoned his
### muse, and she almost always responded.
### The Muses were the nine Greek goddesses who presided over the
### arts (including music) and literature. A shrine to the Muses was
### called in Latin a museum. An artist or poet about to begin work
### would call on his particular Muse to inspire him, and a poem itself
### might begin with such a call; thus, Homer's Odyssey begins, “Sing to
### me of the man, Muse” (that is, of Odysseus). Today a muse may be
### one's special creative spirit, but some artists and writers have also
### chosen living human beings to serve as their muses.

### iridescent
### Having a glowing, rainbowlike play of
### color that seems to change as the light shifts.
### • The children shrieked with glee as the iridescent soap bubbles
### floated away in the gentle breeze.
### Iris, the Greek goddess of the rainbow, took messages from Mount
### Olympus to earth, and from gods to mortals or other gods, using the
### rainbow as her stairway. Iridescence is thus the glowing, shifting,
### colorful quality of a rainbow, also seen in an opal, a light oil slick, a
### butterfly wing, or the mother-of-pearl that lines an oyster shell.

### mausoleum
### (1) A large tomb, especially one built
### aboveground with shelves for the dead. (2) A large, gloomy building
### or room.
### • The family's grand mausoleum occupied a prominent spot in the
### cemetery, for all the good it did the silent dead within.
### Mausolus was ruler of a kingdom in Asia Minor in the 4th century
### B.C. He beautified the capital, Halicarnassus, with all sorts of fine
### public buildings, but he is best known for the magnificent
### monument, the Mausoleum, that was built by his wife Artemisia after
### his death. With its great height (perhaps 140 feet) and many
### beautiful sculptures, the Mausoleum was declared one of the Seven
### Wonders of the Ancient World. Though Halicarnassus was repeatedly
### attacked, the Mausoleum would survive for well over 1,000 years.

### mentor
### A trusted counselor, guide, tutor, or coach.
### • This pleasant old gentleman had served as friend and mentor to a
### series of young lawyers in the firm.
### Odysseus was away from home fighting and journeying for 20 years,
### according to Homer. During that time, the son he left as a babe in
### arms grew up under the supervision of Mentor, an old and trusted
### friend. When the goddess Athena decided it was time to complete
### young Telemachus's education by sending him off to learn about his
### father, she visited him disguised as Mentor and they set out
### together. Today, anyone such as a coach or tutor who gives another
### (usually younger) person help and advice on how to achieve success
### in the larger world is called a mentor. And in recent years we've even
### been using the word as a verb, and now in business we often speak
### of an experienced employee mentoring someone who has just
### arrived.

### narcissism
### (1) Extreme self-centeredness or
### fascination with oneself. (2) Love or desire for one's own body.
### • His girlfriend would complain about his narcissism, saying he spent
### more time looking at himself in the mirror than at her.
### Narcissus was a handsome youth in Greek mythology who inspired
### love in many who saw him. One was the nymph Echo, who could
### only repeat the last thing that anyone said. When Narcissus cruelly
### rejected her, she wasted away to nothing but her voice. Though he
### played with the affections of others, Narcissus became a victim of
### his own attractiveness. When he caught sight of his own reflection in
### a pool, he sat gazing at it in fascination, wasting away without food
### or drink, unable to touch or kiss the image he saw. When he finally
### died, the gods turned him into the flower we call the narcissus,
### which stands with its head bent as though gazing at its reflection.
### People with “narcissistic personality disorder” have a somewhat
### serious mental condition, according to psychologists, but the rest of
### us are free to call anyone who seems vain and self-centered a
### narcissist.

### tantalize
### To tease or torment by offering something
### desirable but keeping it out of reach.
### • The sight of a warm fire through the window tantalized the little
### match girl almost unbearably.
### King Tantalus, according to Greek mythology, killed his son Pelops
### and served him to the gods in a stew for dinner. Almost all the gods
### realized what was happening and refused the meal, though only
### after Demeter had taken a nibble out of Pelops's shoulder. After they
### had reconstructed him, replacing the missing shoulder with a piece
### of ivory, they turned to punishing Tantalus. In Hades he stands in
### water up to his neck under a tree laden with fruit. Each time he
### stoops to drink, the water moves out of reach; each time he reaches
### up to pick something, the branches move beyond his grasp. He is
### thus eternally tantalized by the water and fruit. Today anything or
### anyone that tempts but is unobtainable is tantalizing.

### thespian
### An actor.
### • In summer the towns of New England welcome troupes of
### thespians dedicated to presenting plays of all kinds.
### Greek drama was originally entirely performed by choruses.
### According to tradition, the Greek dramatist Thespis, of the 6th
### century B.C., was the inventor of tragedy and the first to write roles
### for the individual actor as distinct from the chorus, and the actor's
### exchanges with the chorus were the first dramatic dialogue. Since
### Thespis himself performed the individual parts in his own plays, he
### was also the first true actor. Ever since choruses disappeared from
### drama, thespians have filled all the roles in plays. Thespian is also an
### adjective; thus, we can speak of “thespian ambitions” and “thespian
### traditions,” for example.

### zephyr
### (1) A breeze from the west. (2) A gentle breeze.
### • Columbus left Genoa sailing against the zephyrs that continually
### blow across the Mediterranean.
### The ancient Greeks called the west wind Zephyrus and regarded him
### and his fellows—Boreas (god of the north wind), Eurus (god of the
### east wind), and Notus (god of the south wind)—as gods. A zephyr is
### a kind wind, bringer of clear skies and beautiful weather.
