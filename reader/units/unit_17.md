### ANIM
### comes from the Latin anima, meaning “breath” or “soul.” So,
### for example, an animal is a living, breathing thing—though human
### animals have often argued about whether other species actually
### have souls.

### animated
### (1) Full of life; lively, vigorous, active. (2)
### Seeming or appearing to be alive.
### • Her gestures as she talked were so animated that even people
### across the room were watching her.
### Animated cartoon characters have been “given life” by film
### techniques, though the animation of drawings actually goes back to
### handheld toys in the 1830s. A child watching the cartoon may also
### be animated—squealing, laughing, and jumping around—as can a
### crowd of hockey fans or a rock-concert audience. And the best
### discussions and arguments are often highly animated.

### magnanimous
### (1) Showing a lofty and
### courageous spirit. (2) Generous and forgiving.
### • She was magnanimous in victory, saying she'd been lucky to win
### and praising her opponent's effort.
### The basic meaning of magnanimity is “greatness of spirit.” Thus,
### magnanimity is the opposite of pettiness or “smallness.” A truly
### magnanimous person can lose without complaining and win without
### gloating. Angry disputes can sometimes be resolved when one side
### makes a magnanimous gesture toward the other. And it's the mark
### of magnanimity to give credit to everyone who worked on a project
### even if you'd rather it all went to you.

### animosity
### Ill will or resentment.
### • Legend has it that the animosity between the Greeks and the
### Trojans began with the stealing of the beautiful Helen from her
### husband, Menelaus.
### The important Latin word animus (very closely related to anima)
### could mean a great many things having to do with the soul and the
### emotions, one of them being “anger.” As an English word, animus
### has generally meant “ill will,” so it isn't mysterious that animosity
### means basically the same thing. Animosity can exist between two
### people, two groups or organizations, or two countries, and can
### sometimes lie hidden for years before reappearing. The deep
### animosities that exist between certain ethnic and religious groups
### sometimes seem as if they will last forever.

### inanimate
### (1) Not alive; lifeless. (2) Not lively; dull.
### • The sculptures of Rodin are so expressive that, although
### inanimate, they seem full of life and emotion.
### The couch you sit on while you watch TV is an inanimate object, as
### is your footrest, your bag of snacks, and your remote control. Spend
### too much time on that couch and you risk becoming a couch potato.
### (A potato is an inanimate object.)

### FIG
### comes from a Latin verb meaning “to shape or mold” and a
### noun meaning “a form or shape.” So a figure is usually a shape. A
### transfiguration transforms the shape or appearance of something.
### And a disfiguring injury changes the appearance of part of the body
### for the worse.

### figurative
### (1) Representing form or figure in art. (2)
### Saying one thing in terms normally meaning or describing another
### thing.
### • When the poet says he's been living in the desert, it's a figurative
### reference to his emotional life.
### Words and phrases can have both literal and figurative meanings,
### and we all use words with both kinds of meanings every day of our
### lives. We can literally close the door to a room, or we can figuratively
### close the door to further negotiations—that is, refuse to take part in
### them. Figurative language includes figures of speech, such as similes
### (“she's been like a sister to me”) and metaphors (“a storm of
### protest”). And sometimes it's hard to tell whether a phrase is literal
### or figurative: If I say I “picked up” a little Spanish in Mexico, is that
### literal or figurative? You've probably noticed that lots of the
### definitions in this book show both a literal meaning (often something
### physical) and a figurative meaning (often nonphysical).

### configuration
### An arrangement of parts or
### elements; shape, design.
### • We've changed the configuration of the office so that employees
### will have more privacy at their desks.
### The term is very common in computer science and mathematics,
### and in scientific and technological fields in general. Thus, for
### example, two scientists won a 1962 Nobel Prize for their description
### of the configuration of the DNA molecule. Since then, researchers
### have studied what different configurations within the DNA strands
### mean and what they control, and genetic engineers have tried to
### configure or reconfigure DNA in new ways to prevent or treat
### diseases.

### effigy
### An image of a person, especially a crude
### representation of a hated person.
### • The night before the big game, an effigy of the rival coach was
### burned on a huge bonfire.
### It was the practice of the ancient Egyptians to bury an effigy of a
### dead person along with that person's body. The idea was that if
### anything happened to the body in the afterlife, the effigy could be
### used as a spare. Effigy now usually refers to crude stuffed figures of
### the kind that get abused by angry protestors and unruly college
### students. But the small dolls that witches have used to bring pain
### and death on their victims can be called effigies as well. Actually,
### those witches and college kids seem to use their effigies for pretty
### much the same thing.

### figment
### Something made up or imagined.
### • His preference for Cindy is a figment of your imagination; believe
### me, he barely knows she exists.
### A figment is something formed from imaginary elements. Daydreams
### are figments; nightmares are figments that can seem very real. Most
### figments are everyday fears and hopes about small things that turn
### out to be imaginary. But when the radio play “The War of the
### Worlds” aired in 1938, it caused a panic among thousands of people
### who didn't realize the Martian invasion was just a figment of the
### author's imagination.

### ANN/ENN
### comes from Latin annus, meaning “year.” An annual
### event occurs yearly. An anniversary is an example of an annual
### event, although the older you get the more frequent they seem to
### be.

### annuity
### Money that is payable yearly or on some
### regular basis, or a contract providing for such payment.
### • Throughout her working career she invested regularly in annuities
### that would support her after retirement.
### Annuities are handy things to have when you retire, since they
### provide an income on an annual basis or more frequently. Annuities
### are normally contracts with life-insurance companies that specify
### that payments begin at retirement. Company pensions are
### traditionally doled out in the form of annuities, and sweepstakes
### jackpots may also come as annuities. An annuity can be a wise idea
### if you think you're going to live a long time; however, annuities can
### be tricky and should only be purchased after carefully comparing the
### products offered by various companies.

### superannuated
### (1)
### Outworn,
### old-
### fashioned, or out-of-date. (2) Forced to retire because of old age or
### infirmity.
### • He called himself a car collector, but his backyard looked like a
### cemetery for superannuated clunkers.
### A superannuated style is out-of-date—its time has come and gone.
### And a person who has passed an age limit and been forced to retire
### may technically be called superannuated. But more often
### superannuated describes people who seem somehow to belong to
### the past. So a 55-year-old surfer might be regarded as
### superannuated by the young crowd riding the waves in Santa Cruz,
### and a superannuated hippie might still be dressing the way he did in
### 1972.

### millennium
### (1) A period of time lasting 1,000
### years, or the celebration of a 1,000-year anniversary. (2) A period of
### great happiness and perfection on earth.
### • The first millennium B.C. saw the rise of important civilizations in
### Greece, Rome, India, Central America, and China.
### Since in Latin mille means “thousand” (see
### MILL
### ), a millennium lasts
### 1,000 years. Thus, we're living today at the beginning of the third
### millennium since the birth of Christ. But some religious sects, relying
### on a prophecy in the biblical Book of Revelation, speak of a coming
### millennium when Jesus will return to reign on earth for 1,000 years,
### evil will be banished, and all will live in peace and happiness.
### Members of these sects who keep themselves in a constant state of
### preparedness are called millenarians or millennialists.

### perennial
### (1) Continuing to grow for several years.
### (2) Enduring or continuing without interruption.
### • “See You in September” is a perennial summertime hit among
### lovesick teenagers.
### A perennial garden is full of perennials like delphiniums and asters,
### flowers that continue to bloom year after year. (Annuals, by contrast,
### grow for only a single season and must be replanted annually, and
### biennials die after two years.) Evergreens are perennially green; for
### that reason, they're perennial favorites for Christmas wreaths and
### decorations. In a similar way, taxes are a perennial political issue;
### and a perennial political candidate may come back over and over
### claiming he's the only one who can save us from them.

### EV
### comes from the Latin aevum, “age” or “lifetime.” Though the root
### occurs in only a few English words, it's related to the Greek aion,
### “age,” from which we get the word eon, meaning “a very long period
### of time.”

### coeval
### Having the same age or lasting the same amount
### of time; contemporary.
### • Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, probably written around 700 B.C., are
### coeval with portions of the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament.
### Coeval usually describes things that existed together for a very long
### time or that originated at the same time in the distant past. Thus,
### astronomers might speak of one galaxy as being coeval with
### another, and a period in the history of one civilization might be
### coeval with a similar period in another. As a noun, however, coeval
### may describe people as well; so, for example, two artists who lived
### and worked at the same time might be described as coevals.

### longevity
### (1) A long duration of life. (2) Length of
### life; long continuance.
### • Picasso had a career of remarkable longevity, and was producing
### plentifully until his death at 91.
### As living conditions improve and the science of medicine advances,
### the longevity of the average American has increased greatly, from
### about 45 years in 1900 to over 75 years today. But the most
### impressive human longevity is nothing compared to the 400-year
### lifespan of an ocean clam found near Iceland, or the 5,000-year
### lifespan of the bristlecone pine, a tree found in the western U.S. We
### may use longevity to talk not only about actual lives but also of the
### useful “life” of things: the life of your car's tires or the shingles on
### your roof, for example.

### medieval
### (1) Relating to the Middle Ages of
### European history, from about A.D. 500 to 1500. (2) Extremely out-
### of-date.
### • The great cathedral at Chartres in France, finished in 1220, is a
### masterpiece of medieval architecture.
### With its roots medi-, meaning “middle,” and ev-, meaning “age,”
### medieval literally means “of the Middle Ages.” In this case, middle
### means “between the Roman empire and the Renaissance”—that is,
### after the fall of the great Roman state and before the “rebirth” of
### culture that we call the Renaissance. This same period used to be
### called the “Dark Ages,” since it was believed that in these years
### civilization all but vanished. And indeed, for most Europeans in these
### centuries, it was a time of poverty, famine, plague, and superstition,
### rather than the age of magic, dazzling swordplay, towering castles,
### and knights in splendid armor displayed in today's graphic novels
### and video games.

### primeval
### (1) Having to do with the earliest ages;
### primitive or ancient. (2) Existing from the beginning.
### • When European settlers first arrived in North America, they found
### vast tracts of primeval forest, seemingly untouched by human
### influence.
### With its prim- prefix, meaning “first,” primeval obviously refers to an
### original age. So the word often suggests the earliest periods in the
### earth's history. Myths are often stories of the creation of the world
### and of its primeval beings. The trees in a primeval forest (few of
### which remain today in most countries) may be 400 years old—not as
### old as the world, but maybe as old as they ever live to. According to
### scientists, life on earth began in the protein-rich waters of the
### primeval seas and swamps, and the decay of their tiny organisms
### and plant matter over millions of years produced our petroleum and
### coal.

### CORP
### comes from corpus, the Latin word for “body.” A corpse is a
### dead body. A corporation is also a kind of body, since it may act
### almost like an individual. And a corps is a “body” of soldiers.

### corporeal
### Having or relating to a physical body;
### substantial.
### • In paintings, angels usually look very much like corporeal beings,
### often with actual feathered wings.
### In various religions, including Christianity, corporeal existence is
### often called the opposite of spiritual existence, and corporeal
### existence, unlike spiritual existence, is often said to be contaminated
### with evil. The word is also often used by philosophers, especially
### when considering the nature of reality. For lawyers, corporeal
### describes physical property such as houses or cars, as opposed to
### something valuable but nonphysical like a good reputation.

### corpulent
### Having a large, bulky body; obese.
### • Squire Jenkins had often been described as “stout” or “portly,” but
### more recently the word his acquaintances were using was usually
### “corpulent,” or even “fat.”
### The Duchess of Windsor may have said that you can never be too
### rich or too thin, but that's a rather modern point of view. In earlier
### times in Europe, being overweight was considered a sign of wealth
### and well-being, as demonstrated by the corpulence of many
### European kings. Still today, corpulence is thought to be superior to
### thinness in some of the world's cultures. But corpulent and
### corpulence are less often used than they once were, and we're now
### probably more likely to say “obese” and “obesity.”

### corporal
### Relating to or affecting the body.
### • She was reminded that, in the public-school system, shaking a
### child was now regarded as unacceptable corporal punishment.
### The adjective corporal today usually appears in the phrase corporal
### punishment, which means “bodily punishment.” This used to include
### such acts as mutilation, branding, imprisonment, and even death.
### But today execution comes under the separate heading of “capital
### punishment,” which originally involved losing your head (capit-
### meaning “head”). Milder forms of corporal punishment are used by
### American parents, and were once common in schools as well.
### Corporal is occasionally used in other ways; in the traditional church,
### the “corporal works of mercy” include seven helpful acts such as
### sheltering the homeless and burying the dead. Corporal as a military
### rank actually comes from caporal—which has the same root as
### capital.

### incorporate
### (1) To blend or combine into
### something already existing to form one whole. (2) To form or form
### into a corporation.
### • The new edition incorporates many suggestions and corrections
### received by the author from his readers.
### From its roots, incorporate means basically “add into a body” or
### “form into a body.” So, for example, a chef might decide to
### incorporate a couple of new ingredients into an old recipe, and then
### might incorporate that new item into the restaurant's dinner menu.
### The restaurant itself was probably incorporated at the beginning,
### and so is now a corporation—that is, a “body” that's legally allowed
### to act like a single person in certain ways, even if it may have many
### individual employees. As you can see, the two meanings turn out to
### be fairly different.

### TANG/TACT
### comes from the Latin words tangere, “to touch,” and
### tactus, “sense of touch.” So, for instance, to make contact is to
### touch or “get in touch with.”

### tact
### The ability to deal with others without offending them.
### • Already at 16 his daughter showed remarkable tact in dealing with
### adults, which she certainly hadn't gotten from him.
### This word came to English directly from French (a Latin-based
### language), where it can also mean simply “sense of touch.” Dealing
### with difficult situations involving other people can require the kind of
### extreme sensitivity that our fingertips possess. As Lincoln once said,
### “Tact is the ability to describe others as they see themselves,” which
### doesn't usually come naturally. Someone tactful can soothe the
### feelings of the most difficult people; a tactless person will generally
### make a bad situation worse.

### tactile
### (1) Able to be perceived by touching. (2) Relating
### to the sense of touch.
### • He always enjoyed the tactile sensation of running his hand over
### the lush turf.
### If you set your cell phone to vibrate rather than ring, you're taking
### the tactile option. Educators believe that some students are naturally
### “tactile learners,” much better at “hands-on” learning than at tasks
### that involve patient listening and reading. Many longtime readers
### resist using e-books, saying they miss the tactile sensations of
### leafing through an actual book. And the blind, using the raised dots
### of the braille alphabet, rely entirely on their tactile sense to read;
### some can actually read as fast as the average person can read out
### loud.

### tangential
### Touching lightly; incidental.
### • The government is trying to determine if the extremists were
### deeply involved or if their relationship to the suspect was merely
### tangential.
### In geometry, a tangent is a straight line that touches a curve at a
### single point. So we say that someone who starts talking about one
### thing and gets sidetracked has gone off on a tangent. The new
### subject is tangential to the first subject—it touches it and moves off
### in a different direction.

### tangible
### Able to be perceived, especially by touch;
### physical, substantial.
### • The snow was tangible evidence that winter had really come.
### Something that's literally tangible can be touched. A rock is tangible,
### and so is a broken window; if the rock is lying next to the window, it
### could be tangible evidence of vandalism. When we say that the
### tension in a room is tangible, we mean we feel it so strongly that it
### seems almost physical. But if we're being literal, tension, like hope,
### happiness, and hunger, is literally intangible—it may be real, but it
### can't be touched. When lawyers talk about an intangible asset, they
### might mean something like a company's good reputation—very
### valuable, but not quite touchable.

### CODI/CODE
### comes from the Latin codex, meaning “trunk of a tree”
### or “document written on wooden tablets.” A code can be either a set
### of laws or a system of symbols used to write messages. To encode a
### message is to write it in code. A genetic code, transmitted by genes,
### is a set of instructions for everything from blood type to eye color.

### codex
### A book in handwritten form, especially a book of
### Scripture, classics, or ancient texts.
### • There on the shelves of the monastery library they saw codex after
### codex, all carefully copied and illustrated by hand.
### In the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D., the codex began to replace the
### older scroll as the preferred form for longer writings. Unlike the
### scroll, this wonderful invention permitted writing on both sides of a
### sheet, made it easy to locate a particular passage, and could contain
### a very long piece of writing. Codices (note this unusual plural form)
### were usually written on parchment, the specially prepared skin of a
### sheep or goat, or papyrus, the ancestor of paper. Because codices
### were handwritten, there were few copies of any single codex, and
### sometimes only a single copy. Today we no longer write our books in
### longhand, but the modern book has kept basically the same form as
### the original codices.

### codicil
### (1) An amendment or addition made to a will.
### (2) An appendix or supplement.
### • With the birth of each new grandchild, the old man added a new
### codicil to his will.
### A codicil is literally a “little codex,” a little bit of writing on a small
### piece of writing material, used to add to or change something about
### a larger piece of writing. A codicil to a will can change the terms of
### the original will completely, so it generally requires witnesses just
### like the will itself, though in some states a handwritten codicil may
### not. In mystery novels, such changes have been known to cause
### murders; in real life, codicils aren't usually quite that exciting.

### codify
### To arrange according to a system; classify.
### • In the 6th century B.C., the great statesman Solon newly codified
### the laws of Athens, replacing the harsh legal code of Draco.
### A code is a collection of laws arranged in an orderly way; famous
### examples include the Code of Hammurabi, from about 1760 B.C. in
### ancient Babylon, and the Napoleonic Code, produced at Napoleon's
### orders in 1804. Laws that have been included in a code have been
### codified. The rules of baseball differed greatly from one place to
### another until they were codified by Alexander Cartwright in 1845;
### they haven't changed much since, though we don't know what
### Cartwright would say about the designated hitter.

### decode
### (1) To put a coded message into an
### understandable form. (2) To find the underlying meaning of;
### decipher.
### • The Allies were able to decode many important secret messages
### sent by the Germans and Japanese in World War II.
### To decode is to take out of code and put into understandable
### language. (Its opposite is encode, “to put into coded form.”) But
### dreams may sometimes also be decoded; psychologists often try to
### decode the images of their patients' dreams so as to understand the
### emotions behind them. And readers must often decode what a novel
### or story or poem is telling them, which may require two or three
### readings. Decipher is often a synonym, though we now use it when
### talking about reading difficult handwriting.

### SIGN
### comes from the Latin noun signum, “mark or sign.” A signal is
### a kind of sign. Your signature is your own personal sign. And an
### architect's design marks out the pattern for a building.

### signify
### (1) To be a sign of something; to mean
### something. (2) To show or make known, especially by a sign.
### • The improved performance of the students signifies that the new
### approach may be working.
### Signify basically means “to make a sign or signal.” One of its
### synonyms is indicate; the index finger is the finger you point with, so
### to indicate is essentially to point to something. Significant means
### “important”
### and
### significance
### means
### “importance”;
### similarly,
### insignificant means “unimportant” and insignificance means “lack of
### importance.”

### insignia
### A badge of authority or honor; a
### distinguishing sign or mark.
### • Peering closely at the photograph, he could now see clearly the
### insignia of the Nazi SS on his grandfather's chest.
### Insignia are the official signs of rank, titles, or awards. Medals are an
### example, as are the crowns of monarchs. The Catholic church
### employs such insignia as the red robes of cardinals. U.S. presidents
### have the presidential seal, which appears on the stand when they're
### giving a speech. But most of us think first of the bars, stripes,
### badges, and patches of military rank.

### signatory
### A person or government that signs an
### agreement with others; especially a government that agrees with
### others to abide by a signed agreement.
### • More than a dozen countries were signatories to the agreement
### setting limits on fishing in international waters.
### A signatory puts his or her signature on a document that is also
### signed by others. In 1215 the English barons revolted against King
### John and forced him to join them as a signatory to the Magna Carta.
### This agreement stated the barons' own duties to the King but also
### assigned the barons clear rights and limited the King's power over
### them. Though the Magna Carta did nothing for the common people,
### it's often been called the first step toward democracy in the English-
### speaking countries.

### signet
### (1) A seal used instead of a signature to give
### personal or official authority to a document. (2) A small engraved
### seal, often in the form of a ring.
### • The charters of lands and rights of the early American colonies
### were confirmed with the king's signet.
### Signets have been used for thousands of years. The design of a
### signet is personalized for its owner, and no two are alike. The
### ancients used signets to mark their possessions and to sign
### contracts. In later years signets were used to stamp a blob of hot
### wax sealing a folded secret document so that it couldn't be opened
### and read without the design being broken. The Pope still wears a
### signet, called the Fisherman's Ring, which is carved with a figure of
### St. Peter encircled with the Pope's name; after a Pope's death, the
### ring is destroyed and a new one is made.

## Number Words
### QUADR/QUART
### comes from Latin words meaning “four” or
### “fourth.” In English, a quart is one-fourth of a gallon, just as a
### quarter is one-fourth of a dollar. A quadrangle has four sides and
### angles but isn't necessarily square. And quadruplets are four babies
### born at the same time.

### quadrant
### (1) A quarter of a circle. (2) Any of the four
### quarters into which something is divided by two lines intersecting at
### right angles.
### • Washington, D.C., like a number of other cities, is divided into
### quadrants called Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast.
### This word is used for a traditional instrument, used to make
### calculations of altitude and traditionally employed by sailors to
### navigate, which has a piece shaped like a quarter of a circle. A
### quadrant shower is a shower that fits snugly into a bathroom corner
### and displays a curved front, making a quadrant shape on the floor.
### But perhaps quadrant is used most often today to name a particular
### quarter of a city.

### quadrille
### A square dance popular in the 18th and 19th
### century, made up of five or six patterns for four couples.
### • Quadrilles were very popular at balls in the American South before
### the Civil War.
### The quadrille, named for its four couples that form the sides of a
### square, seems to have begun as a French country dance. In the
### 18th century it became fashionable among the French nobility; as
### performed by elegantly dressed aristocrats, it became slow and
### formal. It crossed over to England and from there to New England,
### where it turned back into a dance for the common people. It soon
### evolved into the American square dance, a lively type of dance that
### employs a “caller” to make sure everyone remembers the steps.

### quadriplegic
### Paralyzed in both arms and both
### legs.
### • A motorcycle accident in her teens had killed her boyfriend and left
### her a quadriplegic.
### Quadriplegia is the result of injury or illness, almost always affecting
### the spine. Though a paraplegic has lost the use only of his or her
### legs, quadriplegics are paralyzed in all four limbs. Today voice-
### activated wheelchairs help the quadriplegic get around, and houses
### can be equipped with similar systems to operate lights and
### appliances; monkeys have even been trained to assist quadriplegics
### with everyday tasks. The work of the quadriplegic actor Christopher
### Reeve has led to remarkable advances in developing new nerve
### connections,
### enabling
### some
### determined
### paraplegics
### and
### quadriplegics to walk again.

### quartile
### One of four equal groups each containing a
### quarter of a statistical population.
### • The schools in our town always average in the lowest quartile in
### both reading and math achievement.
### A quartile is a quarter of a specific group that has been tested or
### evaluated in specific ways. The first quartile is the one that scores
### highest and the fourth quartile scores lowest. For achievement and
### proficiency tests, the first quartile is the place to be; for blood
### pressure or cholesterol, the third quartile is healthier.

### TETR
### comes from the Greek word for “four.” In the immensely
### popular video game Tetris, for example, each of the pieces the game
### is played with has four segments. But the root usually shows up in
### long chemical names.

### tetracycline
### A yellow broad-spectrum antibiotic.
### • He was sent home with a prescription for tetracycline and some
### advice about how to avoid Lyme disease in the future.
### Most chemical names are made up of two or more Greek and Latin
### roots strung together. Thus, tetracycline, with its cycl- root from the
### Greek word for “circle,” means “four-ringed”—that is, “consisting of
### four fused hydrocarbon rings.” Antibiotics work against bacteria and
### other tiny organisms (but not viruses); tetracycline, which comes
### from a kind of soil bacteria, is one of the most used of the
### antibiotics. “Broad-spectrum” antibiotics work well on numerous
### organisms; thus, tetracycline has proved effective against acne,
### chlamydia, cholera, rickets, and various lung and eye infections,
### among many other conditions.

### tetrahedron
### A solid shape formed by four flat
### faces.
### • Her son's box kites was a tetrahedron, and its pyramid shape was
### easy to pick out among the traditional designs flown by the other
### children.
### The simplest tetrahedron is made of four equal-sided triangles: one
### is used as the base, and the other three are fitted to it and each
### other to make a pyramid. But the great pyramids of Egypt aren't
### tetrahedrons: they instead have a square base and four triangular
### faces, and thus are five-sided rather than four-sided.

### tetralogy
### A set of four connected literary, artistic, or
### musical works.
### • The Raj Quartet, Paul Scott's long and complex tetralogy of India,
### was made into a highly praised television series.
### Vivaldi's Four Seasons could be called a tetralogy, since it's a set of
### four violin concertos, one for each season of the year. Eight of
### Shakespeare's history plays are often grouped into two tetralogies.
### Wagner's great Ring of the Nibelung, an opera tetralogy based on
### Norse mythology, contains about 18 hours of music. The original
### tetralogies, however, were sets of four plays by the same author
### performed together in ancient Greece; the first three were always
### tragedies, and the last was a wild comedy. Tetralogies were written
### by such great dramatists as Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripedes;
### unfortunately, none of them have survived in their entirety.

### tetrapod
### A vertebrate with two pairs of limbs.
### • His special study was the great seismosaurus, probably the largest
### tetrapod—and the largest land animal—that ever lived.
### The earliest tetrapods, or “four-footed” animals, were mammal-like
### reptiles that evolved before the rise of the dinosaurs and ranged
### from mouse-sized to cow-sized. Today the tetrapods include the
### reptiles, the amphibians, the birds, and the mammals—including
### humans. Though the fish aren't classified as tetrapods, it's quite
### possible that our own limbs began as paired fins hundreds of
### millions of years ago.
