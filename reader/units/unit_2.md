### Review Quizzes 2
### MANIA
### in Latin means “madness,” and the meaning passed over
### into English unchanged. Our word mania can mean a mental illness,
### or at least an excessive enthusiasm. We might call someone a
### maniac who was wild, violent, and mentally ill—or maybe just really
### enthusiastic about something. Too much caffeine might make you a
### bit manic. But the intense mood swings once known as manic-
### depressive illness are now usually called bipolar disorder instead.

### kleptomania
### A mental illness in which a person
### has a strong desire to steal things.
### • Kleptomania leads its sufferers to steal items of little value that
### they don't need anyway.
### Klepto- comes from the Greek word kleptein, “to steal.” Even though
### kleptomania is often the butt of jokes, it's actually a serious mental
### illness, often associated with mood disorders, anxiety disorders,
### eating disorders, and substance abuse. Klepotomaniacs tend to be
### depressed, and many live lives of secret shame because they're
### afraid to seek treatment.

### dipsomaniac
### A person with an extreme and
### uncontrollable desire for alcohol.
### • She didn't like the word alcoholic being applied to her, and liked
### dipsomaniac even less.
### Dipsomaniac comes from the Greek noun dipsa, “thirst,” but thirst
### usually has nothing to do with it. Some experts distinguish between
### an alcoholic and a dipsomaniac, reserving dipsomaniac for someone
### involved in frequent episodes of binge drinking and blackouts. In any
### case, there are plenty of less respectful words for a person of similar
### habits: sot, lush, wino, souse, boozer, guzzler, tippler, tosspot,
### drunkard, boozehound--the list goes on and on and on.

### megalomaniac
### A mental disorder marked
### by feelings of great personal power and importance.
### • When the governor started calling for arming his National Guard
### with nuclear weapons, the voters finally realized they had elected a
### megalomaniac.
### Since the Greek root megalo- means “large,” someone who is
### megalomaniacal has a mental disorder marked by feelings of
### personal grandeur. Megalomania has probably afflicted many rulers
### throughout history: The Roman emperor Caligula insisted that he be
### worshipped as a living god. Joseph Stalin suffered from the paranoia
### that often accompanies megalomania, and had thousands of his
### countrymen executed as a result. J.-B. Bokassa, dictator of a small
### and extremely poor African nation, proclaimed himself emperor of
### the country he renamed the Central African Empire. And even
### democratically elected leaders have often acquired huge egos as a
### result of public acclaim. But megalomaniac is generally thrown
### around as an insult and rarely refers to real mental illness.

### egomaniac
### Someone who is extremely self-
### centered and ignores the problems and concerns of others.
### • He's a completely unimpressive person, but that doesn't keep him
### from being an egomaniac.
### Ego is Latin for “I,” and in English ego usually means “sense of self-
### worth.” Most people's egos stay at a healthy level, but some become
### exaggerated. Egomaniacs may display a grandiose sense of self-
### importance, with fantasies about their own brilliance or beauty,
### intense envy of others, a lack of sympathy, and a need to be adored
### or feared. But, like megalomaniac, the word egomaniac is thrown
### around by lots of people who don't mean much more by it than
### blowhard or know-it-all.

### PSYCH
### comes from the Greek word psyche, meaning “breath, life,
### soul.” Psychology is the science of mind and behavior, and a
### psychologist treats or studies the mental problems of individuals and
### groups. Psychiatry is a branch of medicine that deals with mental
### and emotional disorders, and a psychiatrist (like any other doctor)
### may prescribe drugs to treat them.

### psyche
### Soul, personality, mind.
### • Analysts are constantly trying to understand the nation's psyche
### and why the U.S. often behaves so differently from other countries.
### Sometime back in the 16th century, we borrowed the word psyche
### directly from Greek into English. In Greek mythology, Psyche was a
### beautiful princess who fell in love with Eros (Cupid), god of love, and
### went through terrible trials before being allowed to marry him. The
### story is often understood to be about the soul redeeming itself
### through love. (To the Greeks, psyche also meant “butterfly,” which
### suggests how they imagined the soul.) In English, psyche often
### sounds less spiritual than soul, less intellectual than mind, and more
### private than personality.

### psychedelic
### (1) Of or relating to a drug (such as
### LSD) that produces abnormal and often extreme mental effects such
### as hallucinations. (2) Imitating the effects of psychedelic drugs.
### • In her only psychedelic experience, back in 1970, she had watched
### with horror as the walls began crawling with bizarrely colored
### creatures.
### The most famous—or notorious—of the psychedelic drugs is LSD, a
### compound that can be obtained from various mushrooms and other
### fungi but is usually created in the lab. The other well-known
### psychedelics are psilocybin (likewise obtained from fungi) and
### mescaline (obtained from peyote cactus). How psychedelics produce
### their effects is still fairly mysterious, partly because research ceased
### for almost 20 years because of their reputation, but scientists are
### determined to find the answers and much research is now under
### way. Psychedelics are now used to treat anxiety in patients with
### cancer, and are being tested in the treatment of such serious
### conditions as severe depression, alcoholism, and drug addiction.

### psychosomatic
### Caused by mental or emotional
### problems rather than by physical illness.
### • Her doctor assumed her stomach problems were psychosomatic
### but gave her some harmless medication anyway.
### Since the Greek word soma means “body,” psychosomatic suggests
### the link between mind and body. Since one's mental state may have
### an important effect on one's physical state, research on new
### medicines always involves giving some patients in the experiment a
### placebo (fake medicine), and some who receive the sugar pills will
### seem to improve. You may hear someone say of someone else's
### symptoms, “Oh, it's probably just psychosomatic,” implying that the
### physical pain or illness is imaginary—maybe just an attempt to get
### sympathy—and that the person could will it away if he or she
### wanted to. But this can be harsh and unfair, since, whatever the
### cause is, the pain is usually real.

### psychotherapist
### One who treats mental or
### emotional disorder or related bodily ills by psychological means.
### • He's getting medication from a psychiatrist, but it's his sessions
### with the psychotherapist that he really values.
### Many psychologists offer psychological counseling, and psychological
### counseling can usually be called psychotherapy, so many
### psychologists can be called psychotherapists. The most intense form
### of psychotherapy, called psychoanalysis, usually requires several
### visits a week. A competing type of therapy known as behavior
### therapy focuses on changing a person's behavior (often some
### individual habit such as stuttering, tics, or phobias) without looking
### very deeply into his or her mental state.

### Answers

### CEPT
### comes from the Latin verb meaning “take, seize.” Capture,
### which is what a captor has done to a captive, has the same
### meaning. Captivate once meant literally “capture,” but now means
### only to capture mentally through charm or appeal. But in some other
### English words this root produces, such as those below, its meaning
### is harder to find.

### reception
### (1) The act of receiving. (2) A social
### gathering where guests are formally welcomed.
### • Although the reception of her plan by the board of directors was
### enthusiastic, it was months before anything was done about it.
### Reception is the noun form of receive. So at a formal reception,
### guests are received or welcomed or “taken in.” A bad TV reception
### means the signal isn't being received well. When a new novel
### receives good reviews, we say it has met with a good critical
### reception. If it gets a poor reception, on the other hand, that's the
### same as saying that it wasn't well-received.

### intercept
### To stop, seize, or interrupt (something or
### someone) before arrival.
### • The explosives had been intercepted by police just before being
### loaded onto the jet.
### Since the prefix inter means “between” (see
### INTER
### ), it's not hard to
### see how intercept was created. Arms shipments coming to a country
### are sometimes intercepted, but such interceptions can sometimes be
### understood as acts of war. In football, soccer, and basketball, players
### try to intercept the ball as it's being passed by the other team. In
### years gone by, letters and documents being carried between officers
### or officials were sometimes intercepted when the carrier was caught;
### today, when these communications are generally electronic, an
### intercepted e-mail isn't actually stopped, but simply read secretly by
### a third party.

### perceptible
### Noticeable or able to be felt by the
### senses.
### • Her change in attitude toward him was barely perceptible, and he
### couldn't be sure he wasn't just imagining it.
### Perceptible includes the prefix per-, meaning “through,” so the word
### refers to whatever can be taken in through the senses. A perceptive
### person picks up minor changes, small clues, or hints and shades of
### meaning that others can't perceive, so one person's perception—a
### tiny sound, a slight change in the weather, a different tone of voice—
### often won't be perceptible to another.

### susceptible
### (1) Open to some influence;
### responsive. (2) Able to be submitted to an action or process.
### • She impressed everyone immediately with her intelligence, so
### they're now highly susceptible to her influence and usually go along
### with anything she proposes.
### With its prefix sus-, “up,” susceptible refers to something or
### someone that “takes up” or absorbs like a sponge. A sickly child may
### be susceptible to colds, and an unlucky adult may be susceptible to
### back problems. A lonely elderly person may be susceptible to what a
### con man tells him or her on the phone. And students are usually
### susceptible to the teaching of an imaginative professor—that is,
### likely to enjoy and learn from it.

### FIN
### comes from the Latin word for “end” or “boundary.” Final
### describes last things, and a finale or a finish is an ending. (And at
### the end of a French film, you may just see the word “Fin.”) But its
### meaning is harder to trace in some of the other English words
### derived from it.

### confine
### (1) To keep (someone or something) within limits.
### (2) To hold (someone) in a location.
### • He had heard the bad news from the CEO, but when he spoke to
### his employees he confined his remarks to a few hints that sales had
### slipped.
### Confine means basically to keep someone or something within
### borders. Someone confined to a bedroom or a wheelchair is too ill or
### disabled to be anywhere else. A person under “house arrest” is
### confined to his or her house by the government. At a business
### meeting, the discussion may be confined to a single topic. A town
### may keep industrial development confined to one area by means of
### zoning. And someone confined to the state prison for 20 years has
### probably committed quite a serious crime.

### definitive
### (1) Authoritative and final. (2) Specifying
### perfectly or precisely.
### • The team's brilliant research provided a definitive description of the
### virus and its strange mutation patterns.
### Something definitive is complete and final. A definitive example is
### the perfect example. A definitive answer is usually a strong yes or
### no. A definitive biography contains everything we'll ever need to
### know about someone. Ella Fitzgerald's famous 1950s recordings of
### American songs have even been called definitive—but no one ever
### wanted them to be the last.

### finite
### Having definite limits.
### • Her ambitions were infinite, but her wealth was finite.
### It has come as a shock to many of us to realize that resources such
### as oil—and the atmosphere's ability to absorb greenhouse gases—
### are finite rather than unlimited. The debate continues as to whether
### the universe is finite or infinite and, if it's finite, how to think about
### what lies beyond it. Religion has always concerned itself with the
### question of the finite (that is, human life on earth) versus the infinite
### (God, eternity, and infinity). But finite is mostly used in scientific
### writing, often with the meaning “definitely measurable.”

### infinitesimal
### Extremely or immeasurably
### small.
### • Looking more closely at the research data, he now saw an odd
### pattern of changes so infinitesimal that they hadn't been noticed
### before.
### Just as infinite describes something immeasurable (“without limit”),
### infinitesimal describes something endlessly small. When Antonie van
### Leeuwenhoek invented the microscope in the 17th century, he was
### able to see organisms that had been thought too infinitesimally small
### to exist. But today's electron microscope allows us to see
### infinitesimal aspects of matter that even Leeuwenhoek could not
### have imagined.

### JECT
### comes from jacere, the Latin verb meaning “throw” or “hurl.”
### To reject something is to throw (or push) it back; to eject something
### is to throw (or drive) it out; and to inject something is to throw (or
### squirt) it into something else.

### interject
### To interrupt a conversation with a comment
### or remark.
### • His anger was growing as he listened to the conversation, and
### every so often he would interject a crude comment.
### According to its Latin roots, interject ought to mean literally “throw
### between.” For most of the word's history, however, the only things
### that have been interjected have been comments dropped suddenly
### into a conversation. Interjections are often humorous, and
### sometimes even insulting, and the best interjections are so quick
### that the conversation isn't even interrupted.

### conjecture
### To guess.
### • He was last heard of in Bogotá, and they conjectured that he had
### met his end in the Andes at the hands of the guerrillas.
### Formed with the prefix con-, “together,” conjecture means literally
### “to throw together”—that is, to produce a theory by putting together
### a number of facts. So, for example, Columbus conjectured from his
### calculations that he would reach Asia if he sailed westward, and his
### later conjecture that there was a “Northwest Passage” by sea from
### the Atlantic to the Pacific over the North American continent was
### proved correct centuries later.

### projection
### An estimate of what might happen in
### the future based on what is happening now.
### • The president has been hearing different deficit projections all
### week from the members of his economic team.
### Projection has various meanings, but what they all have in common
### is that something is sent out or forward. A movie is projected onto a
### screen; a skilled actress projects her voice out into a large theater
### without seeming to shout; and something sticking out from a wall
### can be called a projection. But the meaning we focus on here is the
### one used by businesses and governments. Most projections of this
### kind are estimates of a company's sales or profits—or of the finances
### of a town, state, or country—sometime in the future.

### trajectory
### The curved path that an object makes in
### space, or that a thrown object follows as it rises and falls to earth.
### • Considering the likely range, trajectory, and accuracy of a bullet
### fired from a cheap handgun at 100 yards, the murder seemed
### incredible.
### Formed with part of the prefix trans-, “across,” trajectory means a
### “hurling across.” By calculating the effect of gravity and other forces,
### the trajectory of an object launched into space at a known speed
### can be computed precisely. Missiles stand a chance of hitting their
### target only if their trajectory has been plotted accurately. The word
### is used most often in physics and engineering, but not always; we
### can also say, for example, that the trajectory of a whole life may be
### set in a person's youth, or that a new book traces the long trajectory
### of the French empire.

### TRACT
### comes from trahere, the Latin verb meaning “drag or draw.”
### Something attractive draws us toward it. Something distracting pulls
### your attention away. And when you extract something from behind
### the sofa, you drag it out.

### traction
### The friction that allows a moving thing to
### move over a surface without slipping.
### • The spinning wheels were getting no traction on the ice, and we
### began to slip backward down the hill.
### A tractor is something that pulls something else. We usually use the
### word for a piece of farm machinery, but it's also the name of the
### part of a big truck that includes the engine and the cab. Tractors get
### terrific traction, because of their powerful engines and the deep
### ridges on their huge wheels. A cross-country skier needs traction to
### kick herself forward, but doesn't want it to slow her down when
### she's gliding, so the bottom of the skis may have a “fish-scale”
### surface that permits both of these at the same time.

### retract
### (1) To pull back (something) into something larger.
### (2) To take back (something said or written).
### • She was forced to retract her comment about her opponent after it
### was condemned in the press.
### The prefix re- (“back”) gives retract the meaning of “draw back.”
### Just as a cat retracts its claws into its paws when they aren't being
### used, a public figure may issue a retraction in order to say that he or
### she no longer wants to say something that has just been said. But
### it's sometimes hard to know what a retraction means: Was the
### original statement an error or an outright lie? Sometimes a politician
### even has to retract something that everyone actually assumes is the
### truth. Thousands of citizens were forced to publicly retract their
### “wrong” ideas by the Soviet government in the 1930s and the
### Chinese government in the 1960s. Someone wrongly accused may
### demand a retraction from his accuser—though today it seems more
### likely that he'll just go ahead and sue.

### protracted
### Drawn out, continued, or extended.
### • No one was looking forward to a protracted struggle for custody of
### the baby.
### With its prefix pro-, “forward,” protracted usually applies to
### something drawn out forward in time. A protracted strike may
### cripple a company; a protracted rainy spell may rot the roots of
### vegetables; and a protracted lawsuit occasionally outlives the parties
### involved. Before the invention of the polio vaccines, polio's many
### victims had no choice but to suffer a protracted illness and its
### aftereffects.

### intractable
### Not easily handled, led, taught, or
### controlled.
### • Corruption in the army was the country's intractable problem, and
### for many years all foreign aid had ended up in the colonels' pockets.
### Intractable simply means “untreatable,” and even comes from the
### same root. The word may describe both people and conditions. A
### cancer patient may suffer intractable pain that doctors are unable to
### treat. An intractable alcoholic goes back to the bottle immediately
### after “drying out.” Homelessness, though it hardly existed thirty
### years ago, is now sometimes regarded as an intractable problem.

### DUC/DUCT
### , from the Latin verb ducere, “to lead,” shows up
### regularly in English. Duke means basically “leader.” The Italian
### dictator Mussolini was known simply as Il Duce, “the leader.” But
### such words as produce and reduce also contain the root, even
### though their meanings show it less clearly.

### conducive
### Tending to promote, encourage, or assist;
### helpful.
### • She found the atmosphere in the quiet café conducive to study and
### even to creative thinking.
### Something conducive “leads to” a desirable result. A cozy living room
### may be conducive to relaxed conversation, just as a boardroom may
### be conducive to more intense discussions. Particular tax policies are
### often conducive to savings and investment, whereas others are
### conducive to consumer spending. Notice that conducive is almost
### always followed by to.

### deduction
### (1) Subtraction. (2) The reaching of a
### conclusion by reasoning.
### • Foretelling the future by deduction based on a political or economic
### theory has proved to be extremely difficult.
### To deduct is simply to subtract. A tax deduction is a subtraction from
### your taxable income allowed by the government for certain
### expenses, which will result in your paying lower taxes. Your
### insurance deductible is the amount of a medical bill that the
### insurance company makes you subtract before it starts to pay—in
### other words, the amount that will come out of your own pocket. But
### deduction also means “reasoning,” and particularly reasoning based
### on general principles to produce specific findings. Mathematical
### reasoning is almost always deduction, for instance, since it is based
### on general rules. But when Dr. Watson exclaims “Brilliant deduction,
### my dear Holmes!” he simply means “brilliant reasoning,” since
### Sherlock Holmes's solutions are based on specific details he has
### noticed rather than on general principles.

### induce
### (1) Persuade, influence. (2) Bring about.
### • To induce him to make the call we had to promise we wouldn't do
### it again.
### Inducing is usually gentle persuasion; you may, for instance, induce
### a friend to go to a concert, or induce a child to stop crying. An
### inducement is something that might lure you to do something,
### though inducements are occasionally a bit menacing, like the
### Godfather's offer that you can't refuse. Induce also sometimes
### means “produce”; thus, doctors must at times induce labor in a
### pregnant woman. Notice that induct and induction are somewhat
### different from induce and inducement, though they come from the
### identical roots.

### seduction
### (1) Temptation to sin, especially
### temptation to sexual intercourse. (2) Attraction or charm.
### • The company began its campaign of seduction of the smaller firm
### by inviting its top management to a series of weekends at expensive
### resorts.
### Seduction, with its prefix se-, “aside,” means basically “lead aside or
### astray.” In Hawthorne's novel The Scarlet Letter, Hester Prynne is
### forced to wear a large scarlet A, for “adulteress,” after it is revealed
### that she's been seduced by the Reverend Dimmesdale. Seduction
### also takes less physical forms. Advertisements constantly try to
### seduce us (often using sex as a temptation) into buying products we
### hadn't even known existed.

### SEQU
### comes from the Latin verb sequi, meaning “to follow.” A
### sequel follows the original novel, film, or television show.

### sequential
### (1) Arranged in order or in a series. (2)
### Following in a series.
### • In writing the history of the revolution, his challenge was to put all
### the events of those fateful days in proper sequential order.
### Things in sequence, or regular order, are arranged sequentially. Most
### novels and films move sequentially, but some use techniques such as
### flashbacks that interrupt the movement forward in time. Sequential
### courses in college must follow each other in the proper order, just
### like sequential tasks or steps.

### subsequent
### Following in time, order, or place; later.
### • Through all her subsequent love affairs, she never stopped
### thinking about the man who got away.
### The prefix sub- normally means “below,” and the sub- in subsequent
### seems to imply that everything after the first is somehow inferior. As
### the definition states, subsequent can refer to time (“All our
### subsequent attempts to contact her failed”), order (“The subsequent
### houses on the list looked even worse”), or place (“The subsequent
### villages on the river heading east become steadily more primitive”).
### But subsequently, as in “I subsequently learned the real story,”
### simply means “later.”

### consequential
### (1) Resulting. (2) Important.
### • None of our discussions thus far has been very consequential; next
### week's meeting will be the important one.
### Something consequential follows or comes along with something
### else. The “resulting” meaning of consequential is usually seen in
### legal writing. For example, “consequential losses” are losses that
### supposedly resulted from some improper behavior, about which the
### lawyer's client is suing. But normally consequential means
### “significant” or “important,” and it's especially used for events that
### will produce large consequences, or results.

### non sequitur
### A statement that does not follow
### logically from anything previously said.
### • Rattled by the question, his mind went blank, and he blurted out a
### non sequitur that fetched a few laughs from members of the
### audience.
### Non sequitur is actually a complete sentence in Latin, meaning “It
### does not follow”—that is, something said or written doesn't logically
### follow what came before it. It was Aristotle who identified the non
### sequitur as one of the basic fallacies of logic—that is, one of the
### ways in which a person's reasoning may go wrong. For Aristotle, the
### non sequitur is usually a conclusion that doesn't actually result from
### the reasoning and evidence presented. Sometime when you're
### listening to politicians answering questions, see how many non
### sequiturs you can spot.

## Words from Mythology
### Apollonian
### Harmonious, ordered, rational, calm.
### • After a century of Romantic emotion, some composers adopted a

### In Greek mythology, Apollo was the god of the sun, light, prophecy,
### and music, and the most revered of all the gods. Partly because of
### the writings of Nietzsche, we now often think of Apollo (in contrast
### to the god Dionysus) as a model of calm reason, and we may call
### anything with those qualities Apollonian. This isn't the whole story
### about Apollo, however; he had a terrible temper and could be
### viciously cruel when he felt like it.

### bacchanalian
### Frenzied, orgiastic.
### • The bacchanalian partying on graduation night resulted in three
### wrecked cars, two lawsuits by unamused parents, and more new
### experiences than most of the participants could remember the next
### day.
### The Roman god of drama, wine, and ecstasy, Bacchus was the focus
### of a widespread celebration, the Bacchanalia. The festivities were
### originally secret, and only initiated members could participate. There
### was wine in abundance, and participants were expected to cut loose
### from normal restraints and give in to all sorts of wild desires.
### Eventually the Bacchanalia became more public and uncontrolled,
### finally getting so out of hand that in 186 B.C. the Roman authorities
### had it banned. Much the same bacchanalian spirit fills tropical
### carnivals every year, including New Orleans' Mardi Gras.

### delphic
### Unclear, ambiguous, or confusing.
### • All she could get from the strange old woman were a few delphic
### comments that left her more confused than ever about the missing
### documents.
### Delphi in Greece was the site of a temple to Apollo at which there
### resided an oracle, a woman through whom Apollo would speak,
### foretelling the future. The Greeks consulted the oracle frequently on
### matters both private and public. The prophecies were given in
### difficult poetry that had to be interpreted by priests, and even the
### interpretations could be hard to understand. When Croesus, king of
### Lydia, asked what would happen if he attacked the Persians, the
### oracle announced that he would destroy a great empire; what she
### didn't say was that the empire destroyed would be his own. Modern-
### day descendants of the oracle include some political commentators,
### who utter words of delphic complexity every week.

### Dionysian
### Frenzied, delirious.
### • Only in the tropics did such festivals become truly Dionysian, he
### said, which was why he was booking his flight to Rio.
### Dionysus was the Greek forerunner of Bacchus. He was the inventor
### of wine, which he gave to the human race. For that gift and for all
### the wild behavior that it led to, Dionysus became immensely popular,
### and he appears in a great many myths. He is often shown holding a
### wine goblet, with his hair full of vine leaves, and attended by a band
### of goat-footed satyrs and wild female spirits called maenads. In the
### 19th century, scholars such as Nietzsche claimed that the ancient
### world could be understood as a continuing conflict between the
### attitudes represented by Apollo (see
### Apollonian
### ) and Dionysus—that
### is, between order and disorder, between moderation and excess,
### between the controlled and the ecstatic.

### jovial
### Jolly, good-natured.
### • Their grandfather was as jovial and sociable as their grandmother
### was quiet and withdrawn.
### Jove, or Jupiter, was the Roman counterpart of the Greek's Zeus,
### and like Zeus was regarded as chief among the gods. When the
### Romans were naming the planets, they gave the name Jupiter to the
### one that, as they may have already known, was the largest of all
### (though only the second-brightest to the naked eye). When the
### practice of astrology reached the Roman empire from the East,
### astrologers declared that those “born under Jupiter” were destined
### to be merry and generous, and many centuries later this would
### result in the words jovial and joviality.

### mercurial
### Having rapid and unpredictable changes
### of mood.
### • His mother's always mercurial temper became even more
### unpredictable, to the point where the slightest thing would trigger a
### violent fit.
### The god Mercury, with his winged cap and sandals, was the very
### symbol of speed, and the planet Mercury was named for him by the
### Romans because it is the fastest-moving of the planets. His name
### was also given to the liquid silver metal that skitters around on a
### surface so quickly and unpredictably. And the word mercurial seems
### to have come from the metal, rather than directly from the god (or
### an astrologer's view of the planet's influence). Mercurial people are
### usually bright but impulsive and changeable (and sometimes a bit
### unstable).

### Olympian
### Lofty, superior, and detached.
### • Now 77, he moved slowly and spoke to the younger lawyers in
### Olympian tones, but his college friends could remember when he
### was a brash, crazy risk-taker.
### The Greek gods lived high atop Mt. Olympus, which allowed them to
### watch what went on in the human realm below and intervene as
### they saw fit. They insisted on being properly worshipped by humans,
### but otherwise tended to treat the affairs of these weak and short-
### lived creatures almost like a sport. So Olympian describes someone
### who seems “lofty” and “above it all,” as if surveying a scene in which
### other people appear the size of ants. The Olympic Games were first
### celebrated in the 8th century B.C., at the religious site called
### Olympia (far from Mt. Olympus), and Olympian today actually most
### often refers to Olympic athletes.

### venereal
### Having to do with sexual intercourse or
### diseases transmitted by it.
### • In the 19th century syphilis especially was often fatal, and venereal
### diseases killed some of the greatest figures of the time.
### Venus was the Roman goddess of love, the equivalent of the Greek
### Aphrodite. Since she governed all aspects of love and desire, a word
### derived from her name was given to the diseases acquired through
### sexual contact. Most of these venereal diseases have been around
### for many centuries, but only in the 20th century did doctors devise
### tests to identify them or medicines to cure them. Today the official
### term is sexually transmitted disease, or STD; but even this name
### turns out to be ambiguous, since some of these diseases can be
### contracted in other ways as well.
