### NANO
### comes from the Greek nanos, meaning “dwarf.” For a prefix
### meaning “small,” English got by for centuries with the Greek micro-,
### and later mini- came to be used widely as well. But only recently, as
### a result of advances in scientific knowledge and technology, has
### there been a need for a prefix meaning “extremely small”—a need
### that's been filled by nano-, which today is being attached to all kinds
### of words, sometimes not very seriously (nanoskirt, nano-brained,
### etc.).

### nanotechnology
### The science of manipulating
### materials on an atomic or molecular scale, especially to build
### microscopic devices such as robots.
### • Nanotechnology is now seen as contributing to numerous
### environmental solutions, from cleaning up hazardous waste sites to
### producing strong but lightweight materials for auto bodies.
### Nanotechnology, or nanotech for short, deals with matter at a level
### that most of us find hard to imagine, since it involves objects with
### dimensions of 100 billionths of a meter (1/800th of the thickness of
### a human hair) or less. The chemical and physical properties of
### materials often change greatly at this scale. Nanotechnology is
### already being used in automobile tires, land-mine detectors, and
### computer disk drives. Nanomedicine is a particularly exciting field:
### Imagine particles the size of a blood cell that could be released into
### the bloodstream to form into tiny robots and attack cancer cells, or
### “machines” the size of a molecule that could actually repair the
### damaged interiors of individual cells.

### nanosecond
### One billionth of a second.
### • When he finally asked if she would marry him, it took her about a
### nanosecond to say yes.
### The nonserious use of nanosecond is probably much more common
### than the proper technical use. In measurement terms such as
### nanosecond, nanogram, and nanometer, nano- means “billionth”; in
### other kinds of words, its meaning isn't quite so precise. In
### computers, the speed of reading and writing to random access
### memory (RAM) is measured in nanoseconds. By comparison, the
### speed of reading or writing to a hard drive or a CD-ROM player, or
### for information to travel over the Internet, is measured in
### milliseconds (thousandths of a second), which are a million times
### longer than nanoseconds.

### nanostructure
### An arrangement, structure, or
### part of something of molecular dimensions.
### • In the 1990s the physics department, which had been doing
### extensive research on microstructures, began to get deeply involved
### in nanostructures, including nanofoam, nanoflakes, and nanofibers.
### Two important types of nanostructure are nanocrystals (tiny crystals,
### often of semiconducting material) and nanotubes (tiny tubes, usually
### of pure carbon). Nanocrystals made from semiconductors change
### color depending on their size, and are being used for such tasks as
### detecting viruses in living cells. Nanotubes can conduct enormous
### amounts of electrical current, far more than metal wires. They are
### the basic material of tiny “paper” batteries, which can be rolled,
### folded, or cut while still producing power. Nanotubes are also now
### being used in materials for lightweight tennis rackets and golf clubs,
### and may soon enable the manufacture of TV screens no thicker than
### a film.

### nanoparticle
### A tiny particle whose size is
### measured in billionths of a meter.
### • Nanoparticles of iron are being used to clean up soil pollution,
### helping break down molecules of dangerous substances into simple
### compounds.
### Nanoparticles of a material usually have very different qualities from
### those that the material has at its ordinary scale, which is one reason
### why there's such excitement about the possibilities for how they
### might be used in future technologies. Many uses have already been
### developed. Aluminum nanoparticles added to rocket fuel can make
### the fuel burn twice as fast and release much more energy. Silicon
### nanoparticles are increasing the energy efficiency of solar cells by
### allowing the energy from ultraviolet light to be captured for the first
### time. Other nanoparticles are now helping prevent rust in metals,
### produce stronger batteries, enhance the diagnosis of cancer, and
### improve the filtering of water, and the number of other applications
### is growing fast.

### SUPER
### , a Latin prefix meaning “over, higher, more than,” has
### become one of the most familiar prefixes in English, one of those
### prefixes that we use to create new words all the time: supermodel,
### superpowerful, superjock, supersize, supersweet—the list goes on
### and on. This all seems to have started in 1903 when the playwright
### G. B. Shaw translated the German word Übermensch, Nietzsche's
### famous term for the person who rises to heroic heights through
### discipline and creative power, in the title of his play Man and
### Superman. The comic-book character with the same name wouldn't
### make his appearance for another 30 years.

### superfluous
### Beyond what is needed; extra.
### • My Freshman Comp professor removes all superfluous words from
### our essays, and usually ends up shortening mine by about 40
### percent.
### Since the Latin fluere means “to flow” (see
### FLU
### ), you can think of
### superfluous as describing a river with so much water that it's
### overflowing its banks. The word is used in all kinds of contexts.
### Superfluous characters in computer code may keep it from working.
### Most of the buttons on a remote control may strike us as
### superfluous, since we never use them. When a situation “speaks for
### itself,” any comment may be superfluous. And whenever you yourself
### are feeling superfluous, as in a “Two's company, three's a crowd”
### situation, it's probably time to leave.

### insuperable
### Incapable of being solved or
### overcome.
### • In learning to speak again after suffering a massive stroke, he had
### overcome what seemed like insuperable odds.
### From its roots, the literal meaning of insuperable would be
### something like “un-get-overable”; insurmountable is a fairly exact
### synonym. Insuperable is used to describe obstacles, difficulties,
### barriers, obstructions, problems, and objections. Americans love
### stories of people who succeed in spite of terrible handicaps, whether
### as a result of physical limitations, prejudice, poverty, or lack of
### opportunity; such rugged spirits may be called indomitable,
### “incapable of being subdued.”

### supersede
### To take the place of; to replace with
### something newer or more useful.
### • The notorious decision in the Dred Scott case was superseded by
### the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which stated that anyone
### born in the U.S. had all the rights of a citizen.
### The Latin word supersedere means “sit on top of”—which is one way
### of taking someone else's place. Your boss may send around a memo
### that supersedes the memo she sent the day before (the one with all
### the errors in it). Every time the first-class postage rate goes up, the
### new stamps supersede the old ones. In science, a new theory often
### supersedes an older one; for example, the theory that a
### characteristic you acquire during your lifetime can be passed on
### biologically to your children (called Lamarckism) was superseded by
### Darwin's theory of evolution. Watch out when spelling this word;
### supersede is practically the only English word that ends in -sede.

### superlative
### Supreme, excellent.
### • The new restaurant turned out to be an elegant place, and we all
### agreed that the food and wine were superlative.
### Superlative may sound high-flown when compared with a synonym
### like outstanding, but if your next paper comes back from your
### teacher with the comment “Superlative work!” at the top you
### probably won't complain. Since superlative means “best, greatest,” it
### makes sense that superlative is also a term used in grammar for the
### highest degree of comparison. So for the adjective simple, for
### example, the comparative form is simpler and the superlative form is
### simplest; and for the adverb boldly, the comparative form is more
### boldly and the superlative is most boldly.

### Answers

### DE
### in Latin means “down, away.” So a descent is a downward slope
### or climb, and a decline is a downward slide (of health, income, etc.).
### To devalue something is to take value away from it. And you might
### describe a depressed friend as “down.”

### debase
### To lower the value or reputation of someone or
### something.
### • Every year she complains about how Christmas has been debased
### by commercialism.
### Debase is often used to talk about someone's lowered status or
### character. People are constantly blustering about the debased tastes
### of the ordinary American, and especially the debased music of
### America's youth. A commentator might observe that both candidates
### had managed to debase themselves by the end of a political
### campaign. Debase has a special meaning in economics: From time
### to time, governments find that they need to quietly debase their
### countries' currency by reducing the percentage of valuable metal in
### its coins; if they don't, the metal may become more valuable than
### the coin and people will begin melting the coins down and reselling
### the metal.

### defamation
### The
### harming
### of
### someone's
### reputation by libel or slander.
### • In a famous case in 1735, the newspaper publisher J. P. Zenger
### was found not guilty of defamation because everything he had
### printed about the plaintiff was true.
### Harming someone's reputation in speech with falsehoods is known
### as slander, and doing the same thing in writing is known as libel
### (which sometimes includes speech as well). Any ordinary citizen who
### can claim to have suffered harm as a result of such defamation may
### sue. So why aren't politicians suing all the time? Because an
### exception is made for “public persons” (a category that includes
### most other celebrities as well), who must also prove that any such
### statement was made with “reckless disregard for the truth.” And
### although, even by that standard, public persons are defamed all the
### time, most of them have decided that it's better to just grin and bear
### it.

### degenerative
### Causing the body or part of the
### body to become weaker or less able to function as time passes.
### • Alzheimer's is a degenerative disease of the brain, marked by the
### decline of mental and physical abilities.
### Degenerative diseases—including cancer, glaucoma, Parkinson's,
### diabetes, arthritis, and leprosy—are usually contrasted with
### infectious diseases (diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and
### protozoa). However, many infectious diseases (Lyme disease, AIDS,
### etc.) can cause a body or body part to degenerate, and infective
### organisms play a part in some degenerative diseases. Some
### degenerative diseases can be controlled; some can even be cured.
### But no one has yet discovered a way to reverse such degenerative
### conditions as multiple sclerosis, emphysema, or Alzheimer's.

### dejection
### Sadness, depression, or lowness of spirits.
### • Her friends were puzzled by her frequent periods of dejection,
### which seemed to occur with no obvious cause.
### Based partly on the Latin iacere, “to throw” (see
### JECT
### ), dejection
### means literally “cast down”—that is, “downcast.” Like melancholy,
### gloom, and even sadness, dejection seems to have been declining in
### use for many years; instead, we now seem to prefer depression
### (whose roots mean basically “a pressing down”). Since depression is
### also the word used by doctors, lots of people now assume that
### anyone depressed should be taking an antidepressant; if we went
### back to dejected and dejection, we might not be so quick to make
### that assumption.

### NUL/NULL
### comes from the Latin word nullus, “none,” which is itself
### a combination of ne- (“not”) and ullus (“any”). Have you ever
### noticed how many of our negative words start with n-? Think of no,
### not, never, nothing, none, no one, nowhere, and the hundreds of
### non- words—just about all of which go back to the same Greek root.

### null
### (1) Having no legal power; invalid. (2) Having no
### elements.
### • If we can prove that you signed the contract because you were
### being physically threatened, it will automatically be declared null.
### Null is used mostly by lawyers, mathematicians, and computer
### programmers. In law, it usually occurs in the phrase “null and void”
### (which means about the same thing as null itself). When one of the
### parties that has signed a contract doesn't hold up his or her part of
### the deal—for example, if a contract states that a supplier must
### supply a million screws of a certain quality of steel, and it turns out
### the screws supplied were of inferior steel—the other company can
### refuse to pay anything, claiming the contract is null and void. In
### mathematics, null means “lacking any elements”; a null set is a set
### of figures that's actually empty. In computer programming, a null is
### a character that doesn't actually show up as a character, but instead
### may just be required to show that a series of digits or characters is
### finished.

### nullity
### (1) Nothingness. (2) A mere nothing.
### • He couldn't believe she'd actually left him for that nullity—a guy
### with no style, no drive, no personality at all.
### Intellectuals may speak of a book or a film as a nullity, claiming it
### possesses nothing original enough to justify its existence. Legal
### scholars also use the word; a law passed by a legislature may be
### called a nullity if, for example, it's so obviously unconstitutional that
### it's going to be shot down by the courts in no time. And if you're in
### an unkind mood, you're also free to call a person a nullity, if you're
### not instead calling him a nobody, a nonentity, or a zero.

### nullify
### (1) To cancel legally. (2) To cause something to
### lose its value or to have no effect.
### • In soccer or water polo, a penalty can nullify a goal that has just
### been made.
### A legislature may nullify a ban, a law, or a tax by simply passing a
### new law. Election results can be nullified if a court finds the voting
### process was improper, and a court ruling can be nullified by a higher
### court. Even the Supreme Court itself may have its decisions nullified
### by new laws passed by the Congress—though not if a decision is
### based on the Constitution. In the years leading up to the American
### Civil War, Southern states claimed the right to nullify any federal law
### (such as antislavery laws) that they believed to be unconstitutional,
### leading to the Nullification Crisis of 1832. Annul is a close synonym
### of nullify (with the same root), as are abrogate and invalidate.

### annulment
### An official statement that something is no
### longer valid.
### • He requested an annulment of the marriage from the Church, but
### his wife claimed that, after 15 years and two children, the idea of
### annulment was ridiculous.
### Annulment usually applies to marriage. In some states an annulment
### may be carried out by a court (“judicial annulment”), but annulment
### is generally practiced by a church (“ecclesiastic annulment”), and
### principally the Roman Catholic Church, which traditionally hasn't
### permitted divorce. The usual acceptable reason for annulment is a
### “failure to consummate” the marriage by having children. Unlike a
### marriage that ends in divorce, an annulled marriage is considered
### never to have existed. Other things can be annulled as well,
### including a contract (if one party fails to comply with its terms) or an
### election (if it wasn't carried out properly).

### Answers

### ARM
### comes from the Latin arma, meaning “weapons, tools.” The
### root is seen in such English words as arms (i.e., weapons), armed,
### and army. It has nothing to do with the limb that starts at your
### shoulder; the name for that kind of arm comes from the Latin word
### meaning “shoulder.”

### armada
### A large group of warships or boats.
### • The U.S. Navy hopes to build an electric armada, a new generation
### of ships driven by electric power.
### A Spanish word that originally meant simply “armed,” armada is now
### used in Spanish-speaking nations as the name of their national
### navies. In English, the word usually has historical overtones. The
### Great Armada of 1588 was a 120-ship fleet sent by Philip II of Spain
### in an attempt to invade Elizabethan England; it was defeated when
### British forces lit eight ships afire and sent them sailing into the
### Armada's midst, then blocked the passage to the south so that the
### remaining ships were forced to sail northward around Britain in order
### to return home, causing dozens more ships to be wrecked in the
### stormy northern seas. Today we sometimes use the word
### humorously for fleets of fishing boats, rowboats, or canoes.

### armistice
### An agreement to stop fighting a war; a
### truce.
### • Ambassadors from three neighboring countries were trying to
### arrange an armistice between the warring forces.
### Just as the solstice is the time of year when the sun (Latin, sol)
### “stands still,” an armistice is an agreement for armies to stop where
### they are and lay down their arms. The word is associated with the
### truce that marked the end of World War I on the Western Front,
### where the Allies had confronted Germany, in 1918. The day of the
### ceasefire, November 11th (“the eleventh day of the eleventh
### month”), was for many years called Armistice Day; today it's known
### as Veterans Day in the U.S. and as Remembrance Day in Canada
### and Australia.

### armory
### A place where weapons are made or stored.
### • The great military rifles known as the Springfield 30.06 and the M1
### were developed at the Springfield Armory in Massachusetts.
### An armory has traditionally been a military storage compound where
### machine guns, rifles, pistols, ammunition, parts, and accessories are
### kept. In the U.S., National Guard and Reserve units often use
### armories as training headquarters in peacetime. Ever since George
### Washington established the country's first armory in Springfield in
### 1777, arsenals and armories of the Army Ordnance Corps have had a
### remarkable history of arms manufacture.

### disarming
### Tending to remove any feelings of
### unfriendliness or distrust.
### • All of us at the meeting were charmed by the new manager's
### disarming openness and modesty.
### A defeated country is sometimes forced to disarm (give up its
### weapons), and research may be aimed at disarming a deadly virus
### (making it incapable of doing damage). But the meaning of the
### adjective disarming isn't quite so physical. If you say your nephew
### has a disarming smile, you mean that his smile's warmth and
### genuineness disarm the people he meets of any possible suspicion
### or criticism and of any verbal weapons they might have used against
### him.

### SURG
### comes from the Latin verb surgere, meaning “to rise, spring
### up.” Our noun surge means “a sudden, large increase,” and the verb
### surge means “to move with a surge.” A storm surge occurs when
### violent storm winds at sea cause the water to pile up higher than
### normal sea level. A surge protector keeps a spike in electrical current
### from “frying” your computer when a lightning strike sends a sudden
### surge down the wires.

### upsurge
### A rapid or sudden increase or rise.
### • Almost forgotten for years, at 76 he was offered a colorful role in
### an odd little film, which brought an upsurge in interest in his career.
### An upsurge in drug use sometimes leads to an upsurge in crime. An
### upsurge of flu cases can be cause for alarm. And an upsurge of fury
### at overpaid CEOs might lead to new legislation to restrain high
### salaries. We seem to use upsurge more in negative contexts than in
### positive ones, but not always; we usually welcome an upsurge of
### consumer confidence, an upsurge in new-car sales, or an upsurge in
### the stock market.

### insurgency
### A usually violent attempt to take control
### of a government; a rebellion or uprising.
### • The Mexican press was fascinated by the armed insurgency's
### mysterious leader, who wore a mask and went by the name of
### Subcomandante Marcos.
### Insurgencies fall into the category of “irregular warfare,” since an
### insurgency normally lacks the organization of a revolution, even
### though it has the same aims. Revolutions often begin within a
### country's armed forces, whereas insurgencies often arise in remote
### areas, where they gain strength slowly by winning the confidence of
### rural populations. An insurgency may be based on ethnic or religious
### identity, or its roots may be basically political or economic. Since
### insurgencies are rarely strong enough to face a national army head-
### on, insurgents (often called guerrillas) tend to use such tactics as
### bombing, kidnapping, hostage taking, and hijacking.

### counterinsurgent
### A person taking military
### or political action against guerrillas or revolutionaries.
### • Counterinsurgents who build trust with the local population will
### gradually begin to receive useful information.
### A counterinsurgent is, as you might guess, someone who combats
### an insurgency. Counterinsurgency efforts often attempt to win the
### “hearts and minds” of a population by hiring and paying local
### villagers, opening health clinics and schools, organizing sports
### programs, and providing agricultural assistance. These terms were
### first used to describe the American effort to strengthen the South
### Vietnamese government against communist forces in the 1960s—an
### effort that eventually ended in defeat.

### resurgent
### Rising
### again
### into
### life,
### activity,
### or
### prominence.
### • The country had let down its guard over the summer, and in the
### fall a resurgent flu virus overwhelmed the public-health system,
### killing tens of thousands.
### Resurgent means literally a “rising again” (see
### RE
### ). We may speak of
### a resurgent baseball team, a resurgent steel industry, the resurgence
### of jogging, or a resurgence of violence in a war zone. Resurgence is
### particularly prominent in its Italian translation, risorgimento. In the
### 19th century, when the Italian peninsula consisted of a number of
### small independent states, a popular movement known as the
### Risorgimento managed to unify the peninsula and create the modern
### state of Italy in 1870.

### STRAT
### comes from the Latin word stratum, meaning “spread” or
### “bed.” Strata, a form of the same word, came to be used by the
### Romans to mean “paved road”—that is, street.

### stratum
### (1) A layer of a substance, especially one of a
### series of layers. (2) A level of society made up of people of the same
### rank or position.
### • Alcohol and drug abuse are found in every stratum of society.
### In geology, a stratum is a layer of rock or soil that is distinct from
### those above and below it. Rock and soil strata (notice the plural
### form) can be seen in road cuts, cliffs, quarries, riverbanks, and sand
### dunes, and in pieces of limestone, slate, and shale. Archaeologists
### digging in historical sites are careful to note the stratum where each
### artifact is found. Earth scientists divide the earth's atmosphere into
### strata, just as oceanographers divide the ocean's depths into strata.
### And for social scientists, a stratum is a group of people who are
### similar in some way, such as education, culture, or income.

### stratification
### The process or state of being
### formed, deposited, or arranged in layers.
### • The stratification of the lake in summer keeps oxygen-rich cold
### water at the bottom, where coldwater fish such as trout take refuge.
### If you look for it, you'll find stratification almost everywhere. On a
### tall rain-forest tree, there may be different air plants clinging to it,
### different insects crawling on it, and different mammals making their
### homes at different levels. The earth beneath you may be stratified
### into several distinctive layers within the first 20 feet. If the wind
### you're feeling is moving at 10 miles per hour, at 30 feet above your
### head it may be 20 mph, and in the jet stream above that it may be
### 150 mph. If you climb a high mountain in Himalayas, you may begin
### in a lush, wet forest and end up in a windswept environment where
### not even lichen will grow.

### substrate
### (1) An underlying layer. (2) The base on
### which an organism lives.
### • The soil is the substrate of most seed plants.
### With its Latin prefix sub-, “below” (see
### SUB
### ), substrate obviously
### refers to a layer under something else. Rock may serve as the
### substrate for the coral in a coral reef. Tiny wafers of silicon (or
### another semiconductor) serve as the substrate for computer chips.
### Substrate may also mean subsoil—that is, the layer under the
### topsoil, lacking in organic matter or humus. Substrate is part of the
### vocabulary of various other sciences, including chemistry and
### biology. But although it's mostly a scientific term, writers may also
### use it to mean simply “foundation”—for instance, when observing
### that reading is the substrate on which most other learning is based.

### stratocumulus
### A low-lying cloud formation
### appearing as extensive and often dark horizontal layers, with tops
### rounded into large balls or rolls.
### • A dark bank of stratocumulus clouds was moving in quickly, and in
### March that usually meant bad weather.
### When a cloud type forms a broad “layer” over the earth, the strat-
### root shows up in its scientific name. The type called simply stratus
### forms a low layer of gray extending over a large area. Cirrostratus
### (“curl layer”) clouds form a high, thin layer often covering the entire
### sky (but without the wispy curls of ice crystals that give pure cirrus
### clouds their name). Altostratus (“high layer”) clouds form a darkish
### gray mid-altitude layer. Nimbostratus (“rainstorm layer”) clouds form
### a low, dark layer of gray cloud that usually produces light but
### continuous rain, snow, or sleet (but not violent storms of the kind
### that give pure nimbus clouds their name). Cumulus (“heap”) is the
### familiar puffy fair-weather type of cloud; stratocumulus is its more
### wintry version, which spreads out in a fairly flat layer, much less
### “heaped up,” and sometimes dense enough to cover almost the
### whole sky.

### LATER
### comes from the Latin adjective lateralis, meaning “side.” The
### noun for “side” in Latin was latus, and the same word served as an
### adjective meaning “wide.” The relationship between the two isn't
### hard to spot, since something wide extends far out to its sides. So
### lines of latitude extend east-west around the earth, in the dimension
### we tend to think of as its width (unlike lines of longitude, which
### extend north-south, in the dimension that, for some reason, we
### decided to think of as its “length”).

### lateral
### Of or relating to the side.
### • Only in the lateral views did the X-rays reveal an suspicious-looking
### shadow on the lung.
### Lateral shows up in all kinds of contexts. A lateral job change is one
### that keeps you at about the same job level and salary. A coach
### might have special drills to improve his players' lateral speed and
### agility. The British speak of “lateral thinking,” thinking that grabs
### ideas that may not seem to be relevant but turn out to work well—
### what we might call “thinking outside the box.” But we know lateral
### best from football. A lateral pass is a pass of the ball between
### teammates that usually goes to the side and slightly backward from
### the direction in which they're advancing; unlike a forward pass, a
### lateral may be made from any position, and any number may be
### made in a single play.

### bilateral
### Involving two groups or countries.
### • Instead of working on a set of separate bilateral trade agreements,
### they propose bringing the countries of the region together to sign a
### single joint agreement.
### Since the prefix bi- means “two” in Latin (see
### BI/BIN
### ), bilateral
### means essentially “two-sided.” In the days when there were two
### superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union regularly engaged in
### bilateral arms negotiations; such negotiations are much less
### common today. Sometimes bilateral refers to two sides of the same
### thing. A bilateral hip replacement, for instance, replaces both hip
### bones in the same operation. And bilateral symmetry (a term often
### used by biologists) refers to the fact that, in many organisms (such
### as humans), the left side is basically the mirror image of the right
### side.

### collateral
### (1)
### Associated
### but
### of
### secondary
### importance. (2) Related but not in a direct or close way.
### • Though the army referred to the civilian deaths as “collateral
### damage,” since civilians weren't the intended targets, the incident
### aroused intense anger among the survivors.
### If an official talking about some policy refers to a collateral issue, he
### or she means something that may be affected but isn't central to the
### discussion. To an anthropologist, your cousin would be called a
### collateral relative, since he or she (unlike your grandmother, brother,
### or daughter) is “off to the side” of your direct line of descent. As a
### noun, collateral means something provided to a lender as a
### guarantee of repayment. So if you take out a loan or mortgage to
### buy a car or house, the loan agreement usually states that the car or
### house is collateral that goes to the lender if the sum isn't paid.

### equilateral
### Having all sides or faces equal.
### • On her desk she kept an equilateral prism, through which every
### morning the sun would project the colors of the spectrum onto the
### far wall.
### Since equi- means “equal” (see
### EQU
### ), the meaning of equilateral is
### easy to guess from its roots. The word is mostly used in geometry.
### The standard polygons (many-sided geometrical shapes)—the
### pentagon, hexagon, octagon, etc.—are assumed to be equilateral if
### we don't say otherwise; an equilateral rectangle has the special
### name square. But triangles are particularly important, and many
### triangles are not equal-sided. The standard polyhedrons (many-sided
### solids) are also equilateral. Most common is the cube, all of whose
### sides are square. The tetrahedron has four triangular sides and thus
### is a pyramid with a triangular base, unlike the pyramids of Egypt
### with their square bases.

### Answers

### TOM
### comes from the Greek root meaning “cut.” Thus, the Latin
### word anatomia, from which we get anatomy, means “dissection”—
### that is cutting or separating the parts of an organism for detailed
### examination. In a lobotomy, the nerves linking a brain lobe to the
### rest of the brain are removed; even though lobotomies have hardly
### been performed in the last 50 years, the idea can still fill us with
### horror.

### appendectomy
### Surgical removal of the
### human appendix.
### • Appendectomy is an emergency procedure, since appendicitis can
### be fatal if its symptoms are ignored.
### The appendix is a tiny tube attached to the large intestine that no
### longer has any real function. Appendicitis—inflammation and
### swelling of the appendix, usually as a result of bacterial infection—
### generally occurs between the ages of 10 and 19, and is the most
### common reason for emergency surgery in the U.S. today. Since the
### appendix has so little to do, appendectomies normally have no
### negative aftereffects at all. If appendicitis is ignored, bacteria may
### enter the blood and infect other parts of the body.

### gastrectomy
### Surgical removal of all or part of
### the stomach.
### • Gastrectomy is used to treat holes in the stomach wall,
### noncancerous tumors, and cancer, but is performed only when other
### treatments have been rejected.
### Gastr- comes from the Greek word for “belly,” and shows up in
### English in such words as gastric (“relating to the stomach”) and
### gastronomy (“the cooking and eating of fine food”). Believe it or not,
### there are many people today who have had a gastrectomy and live
### without a stomach; some of them need to eat fairly steadily and
### carefully through the day, but many lead almost completely normal
### and even vigorous lives.

### tonsillectomy
### Surgical removal of the tonsils.
### • His daughter's usual doctor thought antibiotics could cure her
### swollen tonsils, but a specialist recommended tonsillectomy.
### The tonsils are the areas of tissue that you can see in the mirror on
### both sides of your throat (not to be confused with the uvula, which
### hangs down in the middle). Tonsillectomy, the most common surgery
### performed on children in the U.S., is intended to relieve tonsillitis, or
### inflammation of the tonsils (usually by strep or staph bacteria). But
### the fact is, tonsillitis can often be successfully treated with
### antibiotics, which means that surgery, including the week or two of
### pain and discomfort that follows it, is generally unnecessary.

### mastectomy
### Surgical removal of all or part of the
### breast.
### • She has always dreaded being disfigured by mastectomy, but her
### talks with the surgeon have calmed her considerably.
### Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women.
### Early cases can often be treated with drugs or with a small operation
### called a lumpectomy (because it removes a lump). Though a “simple
### mastectomy” is larger than a lumpectomy, it allows the breast to be
### reconstructed, using artificial implants or tissue from elsewhere on
### the body. But “radical mastectomy,” which is required when the
### cancer is at an advanced stage, takes much of the chest muscle and
### makes reconstruction impossible.

### IATR
### , from the Greek iatros, “healer, physician,” usually hides in the
### middle of words, where it isn't immediately noticed. A pediatrician
### treats children (see
### PED-
### ). A psychiatrist is a physician who treats
### mental problems. (A psychologist, by contrast, doesn't have a
### medical degree and thus can't prescribe drugs.) And a physiatrist is a
### doctor who practices “physical medicine and rehabilitation,” which
### may involve such things as testing various physical abilities, relieving
### pain through electric heat or massage, or training patients to
### exercise or to use an artificial limb.

### iatrogenic
### Caused
### accidentally
### by
### medical
### treatment.
### • Most medical malpractice suits seek compensation for iatrogenic
### injury.
### In the 21st century, patients with throat infections are no longer
### being bled to death by misguided doctors, like the unfortunate
### George Washington. But iatrogenic injury and death still remain
### serious risks. Because of a doctor's bad handwriting, a patient may
### be given the wrong powerful drug. The sheer number of drugs on
### the market has led to dangerous drug interactions, which often
### occur when one doctor doesn't know what another is doing. Too
### many patients go to the hospital for some common treatment and
### pick up an antibiotic-resistant staph infection. And let's not even
### think about those unlucky patients who wake up to find that the
### surgeon has removed the wrong foot.

### bariatric
### Relating to or specializing in the treatment
### of obesity.
### • In the type of bariatric surgery called gastric bypass, part of the
### stomach is actually stapled off.
### Baros means “weight” in Greek; so, for example, a barometer is an
### instrument that measures air pressure or weight. Bariatric describes
### the medical treatment of serious overweight—that is, obesity.
### Bariatric surgery is only employed when other methods of weight
### loss have been tried and failed. Though stapling the stomach may
### seem extreme, we now know that obesity greatly increases the risk
### of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and stroke, so stomach surgery
### doesn't just help people look and feel better—it's a potential
### lifesaver.

### geriatric
### Of or relating to old people.
### • We guessed we were now in the hospital's geriatric wing, since all
### the patients seemed to be elderly.
### Since most medical care is devoted to those over 65, geriatrics, the
### medical treatment of the elderly, is a highly important specialty. The
### specific problems of the elderly include physical inactivity and
### instability, which result from weakness and loss of energy. Weakness
### of the eyes and ears plays a role, and weakening of the immune
### system often leads to more disease. All these conditions can be
### made worse by mental problems, such as declining intellectual
### activity, declining memory, and depression, which may prevent the
### patient from taking action to improve his or her condition. But the
### effects of aging can be greatly relieved by proper care. And the
### greatest improvement often results when the patient is persuaded to
### become more physically, mentally, and socially active.

### podiatrist
### A doctor who treats injuries and diseases
### of the foot.
### • Like most podiatrists, she spends a lot of time dealing with minor
### complaints like bunions, ankle sprains, arch pain, and hammertoes.
### Most foot problems result from the fact that human feet were never
### designed to walk on asphalt and concrete or even to wear shoes (all
### that cushioning we demand in our shoes may be doing us more
### harm than good). So today we have an entire medical specialty
### devoted to feet. In the U.S., a podiatrist is a doctor of podiatric
### medicine (D.P.M.), who is licensed to perform surgery. The root pod-
### comes from the Greek word for “foot” (compare
### PED
### ). But in
### England a foot doctor is often called a chiropodist, a term that dates
### from the time when the same specialist treated hands as well, since
### chiro- means “hand.”
