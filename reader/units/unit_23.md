### TEXT
### comes from a Latin verb that means “to weave.” So a textile is
### a woven or knitted cloth. The material it's made from determines its
### texture, the smoothness or roughness of its surface. And individual
### words are “woven” into sentences and paragraphs to form a text.

### textual
### Having to do with or based on a text.
### • A textual analysis of 1,700 lipstick names, including Hot Mama and
### Raisin Hell, suggested to the author that the women buying them
### lack a healthy sense of self-worth.
### Before the invention of the printing press, books were produced by
### hand. When the text of a book is copied this way, textual errors can
### creep in, and a text that's been copied again and again can contain
### many such errors. By comparing different copies of a work, textual
### critics try to figure out where the copyists went wrong and restore
### the text to its original form so that modern readers can again enjoy
### the correct versions of ancient texts. When a class performs textual
### analysis of a poem, however, they are looking closely at its individual
### words and phrases in an effort to determine the poem's meanings.

### context
### (1) The surrounding spoken or written
### material in which a word or remark occurs. (2) The conditions or
### circumstances in which an event occurs; environment or setting.
### • The governor claimed that his remarks were taken out of context
### and that anyone looking at the whole speech would get a different
### impression.
### Context reveals meaning. The context of an unfamiliar word can give
### us contextual clues to help us determine what the word means.
### Taking a remark out of context can change its meaning entirely.
### Likewise, people's actions sometimes have to be understood as
### having occurred in a particular context. The behavior of historical
### figures should be seen in the context of their time, when standards
### may have been very different from our own.

### hypertext
### A database format in which information
### related to that on a display screen can be accessed directly from the
### screen (as by a mouse click).
### • Three days ago my mother was asking me why some of the words
### are underlined in blue, but by yesterday she was already an expert
### in hypertext.
### Since hyper- generally means “above, beyond” (see
### HYPER
### ),
### hypertext is something that's gone beyond the limitations of ordinary
### text. Thus, unlike the text in a book, hypertext permits you, by
### clicking with a mouse, to immediately access text in one of millions
### of different electronic sources. Hypertext is now so familiar that most
### computer users may not even know the word, which was coined by
### Ted Nelson back in the early 1960s. It took a few more years for
### hypertext to actually be created, by Douglas Engelbart, and then
### quite a few more years before the introduction of the World Wide
### Web in 1991.

### subtext
### The underlying meaning of a spoken or
### written passage.
### • The tough and cynical tone of the story is contradicted by its
### romantic subtext.
### A literary text often has more than one meaning: the literal meaning
### of the words on the page, and their hidden meaning, what exists
### “between the lines”—the subtext. Arthur Miller's play The Crucible,
### for example, is about the Salem witchcraft trials of the 17th century,
### but its subtext is the comparison of those trials with the “witch
### hunts” of the 1950s, when many people were unfairly accused of
### being communists. Even a social conversation between a man and a
### woman may have a subtext, but you may have to listen very closely
### to figure out what it is. Don't confuse subtext with subplot, a less
### important plot that moves along in parallel with the main plot.

### PLAC
### comes from the Latin placere, “to please or be agreeable to,”
### or placare, “to soothe or calm.” Pleasant, pleasurable, and pleasing
### all derive from this root, even though their spelling makes it hard to
### see.

### placate
### To calm the anger or bitterness of someone.
### • The Romans had a number of ways of placating the gods, which
### occasionally included burying slaves alive.
### Politicians are constantly having to placate angry voters. Diplomats
### frequently need to placate a country's allies or possible enemies.
### Parents are always placating kids who think they've been unfairly
### denied something. And lovers and spouses are some of the
### champion placaters. It's no secret that people with the best social
### skills are often the best at placating other people—and that they
### themselves may be the ones who benefit the most by it.

### placebo
### A harmless substance given to a patient in
### place of genuine medication, either for experimental purposes or to
### soothe the patient.
### • The placebo worked miraculously: his skin rash cleared up, his
### sleep improved, and he even ceased to hear voices.
### Doctors doing research on new treatments for disease often give
### one group a placebo while a second group takes the new
### medication. Since those in the placebo group usually believe they're
### getting the real thing, their own hopeful attitude may bring about
### improvement in their condition. Thus, for the real drug to be
### considered effective, it must produce even better results than the
### placebo. Placebos have another use as well. A doctor who suspects
### that a patient's physical symptoms are psychologically produced may
### prescribe a placebo in the hope that mentally produced symptoms
### can also be mentally cured.

### placidity
### Serene freedom from interruption or
### disturbance; calmness.
### • Her placidity seemed eerie in view of the destruction she had
### witnessed and the huge loss she had suffered.
### A placid lake has a smooth surface untouched by wind. A placid
### scene is one in which everything seems calm; it may even include a
### meadow with a few placid cows grazing on it. Someone with a placid
### personality has an inner peacefulness that isn't easily disturbed. As a
### personality trait, placidity is surely a lot better than some of the
### alternatives; however, the word sometimes describes people who are
### also a bit passive, like those contented cows.

### implacable
### Not capable of being pleased, satisfied,
### or changed.
### • Attempts to negotiate a peace settlement between such implacable
### enemies seem doomed to failure.
### Implacable, with its negative prefix im-, describes something or
### someone that can't be calmed or soothed or altered. A person who
### carries a grudge feels an implacable resentment—a resentment that
### can't be soothed. An implacable foe is one you can't negotiate with,
### perhaps one who's fueled by implacable hatred. And implacable
### sometimes describes things that only seem to be alive: an
### implacable storm is one that seems as if it will never let up, and an
### implacable fate is one that you can't outrun or hide from.

### Answers

### AUT/AUTO
### comes from the Greek word for “same” or “self.”
### Something automatic operates by itself, and an automobile moves by
### itself, without the help of a horse. An autograph is in the handwriting
### of the person him- or herself, and an autopsy is an inspection of a
### corpse by an examiner's own eyes.

### automaton
### (1) An automatic machine, especially a
### robot. (2) An individual who acts mechanically.
### • The work he used to do as a welder in the assembly plant has
### been taken over by a sophisticated automaton designed overseas.
### The idea of the automaton has fascinated people for many centuries.
### A traveler to the emperor's court in Byzantium in A.D. 949 reported
### that mechanical birds sat in a golden tree singing the songs of their
### species; that mechanical lions flanked the throne, roaring and
### switching their great tails; and that, as he stood watching, the
### emperor's throne suddenly shot upward toward the high ceiling, and
### when it slowly descended the emperor was wearing new robes. Early
### automata (notice the common plural form) often relied on water,
### steam, or falling weights to power them. Today automata, often
### called robots, are used in manufacturing plants to build not only
### vehicles but also much smaller electronic equipment.

### autoimmune
### Of, relating to, or caused by
### antibodies that attack molecules, cells, or tissues of the organism
### producing them.
### • His doctors suspected that the strange combination of symptoms
### might be those of an autoimmune disease.
### Any healthy body produces a variety of antibodies, proteins in the
### blood whose job is to protect the body from unwanted bacteria,
### viruses, and cancer cells. The cells and organs that deal with such
### infections make up the immune system. In some people and
### animals, for various reasons, the antibodies become overactive and
### turn on the body's healthy tissues as well; the result is an
### autoimmune disease—an immune response directed against one's
### own self. More than eighty autoimmune diseases have been
### identified, the best-known being type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis,
### lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.

### autonomy
### (1) The power or right of self-
### government.
### (2)
### Self-directing
### freedom,
### especially
### moral
### independence.
### • Though normally respectful of their son's autonomy, the Slocums
### drew the line at his request to take a cross-country motorcycle trip.
### Since nomos is Greek for “law,” something autonomous makes its
### own laws. The amount of autonomy enjoyed by French-speaking
### Quebec, or of Palestinians in certain towns in Israel, or of
### independent-minded regions of Russia, have become major issues.
### The autonomy of individual states in the United States has posed
### serious constitutional questions for two centuries. The autonomy of
### children is almost always limited by their parents. But when those
### parents are elderly and begin driving poorly and getting confused
### about their finances, their children may see the need to limit their
### autonomy in much the same way.

### autism
### \
### A condition that begins in childhood and causes
### problems in forming social relationships and in communicating with
### others and includes behavior in which certain activities are
### constantly repeated.
### • She was beginning to think that her four-year-old's strange
### behavior and complete lack of interest in his playmates might be due
### to autism.
### Autism, in its strict sense, becomes evident before the age of 3. The
### autistic child generally refuses to talk, becomes obsessive about
### toys, resists any change vehemently, and sometimes flies into
### unexplained rages. Autism is believed to be biological in origin, and
### seems to be related to several milder conditions such as Asperger's
### syndrome. As many as 1 in 100 children, mostly boys, may have
### autism, Asperger's, or a related condition. About one in ten autistic
### children turns out to have a remarkable mental gift, such as the
### ability to play a difficult piece on the piano after a single hearing or
### repair a complex machine without any training. Many autistic
### children seem to grow out of it as they become adults, and some
### autistic adults manage to live independently. Autistic is sometimes
### used loosely to describe a much more common kind of psychological
### withdrawal in adults.

### GRAT
### comes from the Latin words gratus, meaning “pleasing,
### welcome, or agreeable,” and gratia, meaning “grace, agreeableness,
### or pleasantness.” A meal that's served graciously will be received
### with gratitude by grateful guests; those who show no appreciation
### could be called ingrates.

### gratify
### (1) To be a source of pleasure or satisfaction;
### give pleasure or satisfaction to. (2) To give in to; indulge or satisfy.
### • It gratified him immensely to see his daughter bloom so beautifully
### in high school.
### A gratifying experience is quietly pleasing or satisfying. But gratifying
### an impulse means giving in to it, which isn't always such a good
### idea, and “instant gratification” of every desire will result in a life
### based on junk food and worse. Truly gratifying experiences and
### accomplishments usually are the result of time and effort.

### gratuity
### Something, especially a tip, given freely.
### • After sitting for three hours over a six-course meal at Le Passage,
### we always leave the waiter a very generous gratuity.
### Gratuity is a fancier and more formal word than tip. It occurs most
### often in written notices along the lines of “Gratuities accepted.” Its
### formality makes it best suited for describing tips of the dignified,
### expensive variety. For the taxi driver who takes you to the superb
### Belgian restaurant, it's a tip; for the restaurant's maitre d', it's a
### gratuity.

### gratuitous
### Not called for by the circumstances.
### • Members of the committee were objecting to what they considered
### gratuitous violence on television.
### In its original sense, gratuitous can refer to anything given freely,
### like a tip. But the word now almost always applies to something
### that's seen as not only unnecessary (like a tip, which you don't really
### have to give) but also unwelcome. To insult or criticize someone
### gratuitously is to make a hurtful remark that's uncalled for and
### undeserved. But scenes in a film that you yourself might call
### gratuitous were, unfortunately, probably put there to attract an
### audience that wants to see them.

### ingratiate
### To gain favor or acceptance by making
### a deliberate effort.
### • None of her attempts to ingratiate herself with the professor
### seemed to improve her grades.
### To ingratiate yourself is to put yourself in someone's good graces—
### that is, to gain someone's approval. People often try to ingratiate
### themselves by engaging in an activity known by such names as
### bootlicking, apple-polishing, and brownnosing. But some people are
### able to win favor just by relying on their ingratiating smiles.

### CLAM/CLAIM
### comes from the Latin verb clamare, meaning “to
### shout or cry out.” To claim often means “to call for.” And an
### exclamation is a cry of shock, joy, or surprise.

### clamor
### (1) Noisy shouting; loud, continuous noise. (2)
### Strong and active protest or demand.
### • The clamor in the hallways between classes was particularly loud
### that morning as news of the state championship swept through the
### student body.
### The clamor on Broadway at midday can be astonishing to a tourist
### from a midwestern town; if they happen to be digging up the street
### with jackhammers, the clamor can be even worse. The clamor on
### the floor of a stock exchange goes on without stopping for seven
### hours every day. A clamor of protest may sometimes be quieter, but
### is often just as hard to ignore. A politican who receives a thousand
### e-mails a day clamoring for his resignation might as well be listening
### to an angry crowd.

### acclamation
### (1) A loud, eager indication of
### approval, praise, or agreement. (2) An overwhelming yes vote by
### cheers, shouts, or applause.
### • To the principal's suggestion that Friday be a holiday to honor the
### victors in the national math olympics, the students yelled their
### approval in a long and loud acclamation.
### Approval can come from a single person, but acclamation requires a
### larger audience. An acclaimed movie is widely praised, and critical
### acclaim can lead to box-office success. When a popular proposal
### comes up in a legislature, the speaker may ask that it be passed “by
### acclamation,” which means that everyone just gets to yell and cheer
### in approval and no one bothers counting the votes at all.

### declaim
### To speak in the formal manner of someone
### delivering a speech.
### • Almost any opinion can sound convincing if it's declaimed loudly
### and with conviction.
### Declaiming suggests an unnatural style of speech best suited to a
### stage or podium. Listening to an actor declaim a passage in a
### Shakespeare play can be enjoyable. Listening to Aunt Ida at Sunday
### dinner declaiming on the virtues of roughage might not be. Most
### people don't appreciate being treated as an audience, and good
### advice is usually more welcome when it's not given in a declamatory
### style.

### proclaim
### To declare or announce publicly, officially, or
### definitely.
### • He burst into the dorm room, jumped onto his bed, and proclaimed
### that he had just aced the sociology exam.
### The pro- in proclaim means “forward, out,” so a proclamation is an
### “outward” statement intended for the public. We often think of
### proclamations as something issued by monarchs or dictators, but
### Lincoln was able to issue his Emancipation Proclamation because as
### president he had the power to free the slaves in certain areas. At a
### slightly lower level, a governor may proclaim a day in honor of the
### state's firemen, a movie critic may proclaim a director to be the best
### of all, or you may proclaim your New Year's resolutions to a crowd of
### friends.

### CRAC/CRAT
### comes from the Greek word meaning “power.”
### Attached to another root, it indicates which group holds the power.
### With demos, the Greek word for “people,” it forms democracy, a
### form of government in which the people rule. A theocracy, from the
### Greek theos, “god,” is government based on divine guidance. In a
### meritocracy, people earn power by their own merit.

### aristocrat
### The highest social class in a country,
### usually because of birth and wealth.
### • A wealthy aristocrat from a famous European family, she surprised
### everyone by becoming a supporter of little-known jazz musicians.
### Since aristos means “best” in Greek, ancient Greeks such as Plato
### and Aristotle used the word aristocracy to mean a system of rule by
### the best people—that is, those who deserved to rule because of their
### intelligence and moral excellence. But this kind of “best” soon
### became something you could inherit from your parents. The United
### States has no formal aristocracy—no noble titles such as baron or
### marquis that stay in the family—but certain American families have
### achieved an almost aristocratic status because of the wealth they've
### held onto for generations.

### autocratic
### (1) Having to do with a form of
### government in which one person rules. (2) Resembling the ruler of
### such a government.
### • It's hard to believe that a guy who seems so nice to his friends is
### an autocratic boss who sometimes fires people just because he's in a
### bad mood.
### Autos in Greek means “same” or “self,” so in an autocratic
### government all the power is held by the leader him- or herself.
### Autocratic governments are often called dictatorships, or sometimes
### autocracies. In everyday life, a teacher, a parent, or a football coach
### can all behave like autocrats as well.

### bureaucrat
### (1) An appointed government official. (2)
### An official of a government or system that is marked by fixed and
### complex rules that often result in long delays.
### • To settle his insurance claim he had to make his way through four
### or five bureaucrats, every one of them with a new form to fill out.
### In French, a bureau is a desk, so bureaucracy means basically
### “government by people at desks.” Despite the bad-mouthing they
### often get, partly because they usually have to stick so close to the
### rules, bureaucrats do almost all the day-to-day work that keeps a
### government running. The idea of a bureaucracy is to split up the
### complicated task of governing a large country into smaller jobs that
### can be handled by specialists. Bureaucratic government is nothing
### new; the Roman empire had an enormous and complex bureaucracy,
### with the bureaucrats at lower levels reporting to bureaucrats above
### them, and so on up to the emperor himself.

### plutocracy
### (1) Government by the wealthy. (2) A
### controlling class of wealthy people.
### • Theodore Roosevelt sought to limit the power held by the
### plutocracy of wealthy industrialists.
### Ploutos was Greek for “wealth,” and Plouton, or Pluto, was one of
### the names used for the Greek god of the underworld, where all the
### earth's mineral wealth was stored. So a plutocracy governs or wields
### power through its money. The economic growth in the U.S. in the
### late 19th century produced a group of enormously wealthy
### plutocrats. Huge companies like John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil
### gained serious political power, and Rockefeller was able to influence
### lawmakers in states where his businesses operated. For this reason,
### it was said in 1905 that Ohio and New Jersey were plutocracies, not
### democracies.

### PUNC
### comes from the Latin noun punctum, meaning “point.” A
### period is a form of punctuation that's literally a point, and a
### punctured tire has been pricked by a sharp point.

### punctilious
### Very careful about the details of codes
### or conventions.
### • A proofreader has to be punctilious about spelling and punctuation.
### A punctilio is a small point—a minor rule, or a little detail of conduct
### in a ceremony. A person who pays close attention to such minor
### details is punctilious. Punctiliousness can be valuable, especially for
### certain kinds of tasks, as long as you don't become so concerned
### about small points that you fail to pay attention to the large ones.

### punctual
### Being on time; prompt.
### • The company had become much more punctual under the new
### president, and every meeting started precisely on time.
### The original meaning of punctual described a puncture made by a
### surgeon. The word has meant lots of other things through the
### centuries, usually involving being precise about small points. And
### today punctuality is all about time; a punctual train or a punctual
### payment or a punctual person shows up “on the dot.”

### compunction
### (1) Anxiety caused by guilt. (2) A
### slight misgiving.
### • Speeding is something many people seem to do without
### compunction, their only concern being whether they'll get caught.
### Compunction is most often used in describing people who don't feel
### it—that is, who aren't “stung” or “pricked” by conscience. Ruthless
### businessmen steal clients and contracts from other businessmen
### without compunction, and hardened criminals have no compunctions
### about armed robbery and worse. Notice how compunction can be
### used in a noncountable way, like guilt (“He killed without
### compunction”), or in the plural, like qualm (”She had no
### compunctions about lying”). But words like guilt, qualm, regret,
### remorse, doubt, and unease, unlike compunction, are often used
### when talking about people who actually suffer from them.

### acupuncture
### A method of relieving pain or
### curing illness by inserting fine needles through the skin at specific
### points.
### • As a last resort he agreed to try acupuncture treatment with Dr.
### Lu, and his pain vanished like magic.
### In Latin, acus means “needle,” and the English word acupuncture
### was coined way back in the 17th century to describe a technique the
### Chinese had already been using for 2,000 years. An acupuncturist
### may insert many extremely fine needles at a time; the treatment is
### usually uncomfortable but not truly painful. In China today, even
### major surgery is often carried out using only acupuncture to kill the
### pain; it's also used for many other conditions, including insomnia,
### depression, smoking, and overweight. Acupuncture is based on
### ancient theories of bodily energy that few Western doctors have ever
### accepted; but even though attempts to explain its effects by Western
### science have been unsuccessful, it's now widely recognized by
### doctors as effective for pain reduction.

### POT
### comes from the Latin adjective potens, meaning “able.” Our
### English word potent means “powerful” or “effective,” whether for
### good or bad. A potent new antibiotic might be able to deal with
### infections that have developed resistance to older drugs; an
### industrial gas might be identified as a potent contributor to climate
### change; and a potent drink might leave you staggering.

### potential
### (1) The possibility that something will
### happen in the future. (2) A cause for hope.
### • If the plan works we'll be millionaires, but the potential for disaster
### is high.
### Potential can be either good or bad. Studying hard increases the
### potential for success, but wet roads increase the potential for
### accidents. But when a person or thing “has potential,” we always
### expect something good from it in the future. As an adjective (as in
### “potential losses,” “potential benefits,” etc.), potential usually means
### simply “possible.” In science, however, the adjective has a special
### meaning: Potential energy is the kind of stored energy that a
### boulder sitting at the top of a cliff has (the opposite of kinetic
### energy, which is what it has as it rolls down that cliff).

### impotent
### Lacking power or strength.
### • The government now knows it's utterly impotent to stop the
### violence raging in the countryside, and has basically retreated to the
### capital city.
### A police department may be impotent to stop the flow of drugs into
### a neighborhood. A group of countries may be impotent to force
### another country to change its human-rights policies. The impotence
### of a prime minister may be shown by her inability to get an
### important piece of legislation passed. Impotent and impotence may
### also have a special meaning, when they refer to a man's inability to
### have sexual intercourse.

### plenipotentiary
### A person, such as a
### diplomat, who has complete power to do business for a government.
### • In the Great Hall, in the presence of the Empress, the
### plenipotentiaries of four European nations put their signatures on
### the treaty.
### Back in the 12th century, when the Roman Catholic Church in some
### ways resembled the powerful Roman empire that had come before
### it, the Church revived the Roman concept of an official with plena
### potens—“full powers”—to negotiate agreements (see
### PLE/PLEN
### ).
### Whereas an ambassador could only make offers that a faraway ruler
### had specified, often weeks or months earlier, a plenipotentiary could
### negotiate an entire agreement without checking back constantly with
### his ruler. Today, with instant electronic communications, this
### distinction has generally lost its importance, but there are still
### ambassadors who wouldn't be allowed at a negotiating table.

### potentate
### A powerful ruler.
### • After 18 years as president of the college, he wielded power like a
### medieval potentate, and no one on the faculty or staff dared to
### challenge him.
### Like such titles as grand vizier, caliph, and khan, potentate summons
### up thoughts of absolute rulers of an earlier age in such lands as

## Greek and Latin Borrowings
### ambrosia
### (1) The food of the Greek and Roman
### gods. (2) Something extremely pleasant to taste or smell.
### • After two days lost in the woods, the simple stew tasted like
### ambrosia to them.
### Ambrosia literally means “immortality” in Greek, and in Greek and
### Roman mythology only the immortals—the gods and goddesses—
### could eat ambrosia or drink nectar. Both may have been divine
### forms of honey. The gods also used nectar and ambrosia like oils for
### ceremonial anointing, and a mixture of water, oil, and fruits called
### ambrosia came to be used in human ceremonies as well. Since we
### can't know what the mythical ambrosia tasted or smelled like, we
### mere mortals are free to give the name to our favorite ambrosial
### dessert—perhaps one involving oranges, coconut, and heavy cream.

### dogma
### (1) Something treated as established and
### accepted opinion. (2) A principle or set of principles taught by a
### religious organization.
### • New findings about how animals communicate are challenging the
### current dogma in the field.
### Religious dogma and scientific dogma are sometimes at odds, as in
### arguments between those who believe in the biblical story of
### creation and those who believe in evolution. Since all dogma resists
### change, arguments of any kind are harder to resolve when both
### sides are dogmatic in their beliefs. Dogma and dogmatic are
### generally used disapprovingly; it's always other people who believe
### unquestioningly in dogma and who take a dogmatic approach to
### important issues.

### gratis
### Without charge; free.
### • The service is gratis, since it comes as part of a package deal.
### Gratis comes from the Latin word for “favor”; so in English a party
### favor is a small item given gratis to everyone attending a party.
### Gratis is used as both an adjective (“The drinks were gratis”) and an
### adverb (“Drinks were served gratis”). But however it's used, it
### means “free.”

### eureka
### An exclamation used to express triumph and
### delight on a discovery.
### • The mountain town of Eureka, California, was named for the cries
### of delight by prospectors when they discovered gold in them thar
### hills.
### Eureka means “I have found” in Greek. The story goes that the
### Greek inventor Archimedes, given the task of determining the purity
### of gold in a crown, shouted “Eureka!” one day after stepping into a
### bath and making water slop over the side, when he suddenly
### realized that the weight of water displaced indicated the bulk of his
### body, but that a larger body made of lighter matter might weigh the
### same but would displace more water. Thus, a crown in which lighter
### metal had secretly been mixed with the gold would reveal itself in
### the same way. The story may not be true, but we still shout
### “Eureka!” when we make a sudden, welcome discovery.

### per se
### By, of, or in itself; as such.
### • He claims that the reason for the invasion wasn't oil per se, but
### rather the country's dangerous military power, which had been made
### possible by its oil.
### We generally use per se to distinguish between something in its
### narrow sense and some larger thing that it represents. Thus, you
### may have no objection to educational testing per se, but rather to
### the way testing is done. An opposition party may attack a president's
### policy not because they dislike the policy per se but because they
### want to weaken the president. And when New York's police chief
### decided to crack down on small crimes, it wasn't the small crimes
### per se that were his target, but instead the larger crimes which he
### believed would be reduced because of this new approach.

### opus
### A creative work, especially a musical composition or
### set of compositions numbered in order of publication.
### • Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is also known as Opus (Op.) 125.
### A literary opus is often a single novel, though the word may
### sometimes refer to all of a writer's works. But opus normally is used
### for musical works. Mendelssohn's Opus 90 is his Italian Symphony,
### for example, and Brahms's Op. 77 is his Violin Concerto. Since many
### composers' works were never given opus numbers in an orderly way,
### they now often have catalog numbers assigned by later scholars. So
### Haydn's Symphony No. 104 is Hob.104 (Hob. is short for Anthony
### van Hoboken, the cataloger), and Mozart's Marriage of Figaro is
### K.492 (K. stands for Ludwig Köchel).

### impetus
### (1) A driving force or impulse; something that
### makes a person try or work hard; incentive. (2) Momentum.
### • The promise of a nice bonus gave us all an added impetus for
### finishing the project on time.
### An impetus can be something positive and pleasant, or something
### negative and unpleasant, but in either case it stimulates action. The
### need to earn a living provides many people with the impetus to drag
### themselves out of bed five mornings a week. On the other two days,
### the impetus might be the smell of bacon cooking, or the idea of an
### early-morning round of golf. Impetus can be used either with an or
### the in front of it (“The accident provided an impetus for changing
### the safety regulations”) or without them (“His discoveries have given
### impetus to further research”).

### thesis
### (1) An opinion or proposition that a person
### presents and tries to prove by argument. (2) An extended paper that
### contains the results of original research, especially one written by a
### candidate for an academic degree.
### • She's done all the coursework needed for her master's degree but
### hasn't yet completed her thesis.
### In high school, college, or graduate school, students often have to
### write a thesis on a topic in their major field of study. In many fields,
### a final thesis is the biggest challenge involved in getting a master's
### degree, and the same is true for students studying for a Ph.D. (a
### Ph.D. thesis is often called a dissertation). But a thesis may also be
### an idea; so in the course of the paper the student may put forth
### several theses (notice the plural form) and attempt to prove them.
