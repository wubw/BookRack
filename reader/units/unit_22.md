### ACER/ACR
### comes from the Latin adjective acer, meaning “sharp”
### or “sour.” Grapefruit and limes have an acid taste; acid can also
### describe a person's sense of humor (other words for it might be
### sharp or biting). The acidity of the soil often indicates whether it's
### good for growing certain crops; blueberries, for instance, love acid
### soil, so they're more likely to be found east of the Mississippi River,
### where acid soil is the rule.

### acerbic
### Sharp or biting in temper, mood, or tone.
### • She had enjoyed his acerbic humor for years, but then a friend told
### her about the nasty jokes he was making about her behind her back.
### Acerbic often describes wit. An acerbic critic won't make many
### friends among the writers or artists whose work is being criticized,
### but often keeps his or her readers amused and entertained. Acerbity
### may be slightly less sharp than sarcasm, but not much; both words
### have roots meaning basically “cut.”

### acrid
### Unpleasantly sharp and harsh; bitter.
### • The acrid odor of gunpowder hung in the air long after the shots'
### echoes had died away.
### Acrid exactly fits the smoke from a fire—a burning building or forest,
### for example. Dense smog may cast an acrid pall over a city, making
### throats burn and eyes sting. But, like acid and acerbic, acrid
### sometimes also describes nonphysical things, such as the remarks of
### a bitter person.

### acrimony
### Harsh or bitter sharpness in words,
### manner, or temper.
### • Town meetings here were usually civilized, and no one could recall
### an issue that had ever aroused such intense acrimony as the new
### pulp mill.
### Acrimony is angry harshness that usually springs from intense
### personal dislike. An acrimonious exchange is full of cutting,
### unpleasant remarks designed to hurt. Civil wars are often more
### acrimonious and bloody than foreign wars. In the same way, a bad
### divorce may be more acrimonious than any other kind of legal battle.

### exacerbate
### To make worse, more violent, or more
### severe.
### • The increase in coal-burning power plants has greatly exacerbated
### the buildup of greenhouse gases.
### To exacerbate is not to cause, but only to make something bad even
### worse. So the loss of a major industry in a city may exacerbate its
### already serious unemployment problem. A vicious remark can
### exacerbate a quarrel. Building a new mall may exacerbate an area's
### existing traffic problems. A new drug can exacerbate the side effects
### of the drug a patient is already taking. It used to be thought that too
### much blood in the body exacerbated a fever, so the patient's blood
### would be drained, often by means of leeches—and not all patients
### survived.

### STRICT
### comes from the Latin verb meaning “to draw tight, bind, or
### tie.” So the English word strict means “tightly controlled.” And when
### someone begins a sentence “Strictly speaking, . . .” you know he or
### she is going to be talking about a word or idea in its most limited
### sense, “drawing tight” the meaning till it's as narrow as possible.

### stricture
### (1) A law or rule that limits or controls
### something; restriction. (2) A strong criticism.
### • There are severe legal strictures on the selling of marijuana in
### almost every state.
### Stricture has meant many things through the centuries, and its
### “restriction” meaning—probably the most common one today—is
### actually the most recent. High-school teachers often put strictures
### on texting during class. Cities concerned about their murder rate
### have slapped strictures on the possession of handguns. And the
### United Nations may vote to put strictures on arms sales to a country
### that keeps violating international treaties. With the meaning “strong
### criticism,” stricture is slightly old-fashioned today, but it's still used
### by intellectuals. So, for example, an article may amount to a harsh
### stricture on the whole medical profession, or an art review may just
### express the critic's strictures on sentimental paintings of cute little
### houses with glowing windows.

### restrictive
### (1) Serving or likely to keep within bounds.
### (2) Serving or tending to place under limits as to use.
### • The deed to the property had a restrictive covenant forbidding any
### development of the land for 50 years.
### Restrictive covenants (that is, agreements) in real-estate deeds were
### once used to forbid the buyer from ever selling the property to
### anyone of another race. These are now illegal, though other kinds of
### restrictive covenants are very common; in some neighborhoods, they
### may even tell you what colors you can't paint your house. In
### grammar, a restrictive clause is one that limits the meaning of
### something that comes before it. In the sentence “That's the
### professor who I'm trying to avoid,” “who I'm trying to avoid” is a
### restrictive clause, since it's what identifies the professor. But in the
### sentence “That's my History professor, who I'm trying to avoid,” the
### same clause is nonrestrictive, since the professor has already been
### identified as “my History professor.” There should always be a
### comma before a nonrestrictive clause, but not before a restrictive
### clause.

### constrict
### (1) To draw together or make narrow. (2) To
### limit.
### • She felt that small towns, where everyone seems to know every
### move you make and is just waiting to gossip about it, can constrict
### your life terribly.
### Arteries constricted by cholesterol slow the flow of blood, just as
### traffic arteries or highways constricted by accidents slow the flow of
### traffic. But constriction isn't always physical. Economic growth may
### be constricted by trade barriers. A narrow, constricted life may be
### the result of poverty or lack of opportunity. And an actress may feel
### constricted by a role she played as a child or by her TV character
### from years ago, which the public refuses to forget.

### vasoconstrictor
### Something such as a nerve
### fiber or a drug that narrows a blood vessel.
### • For operations like this, my dentist likes to use a vasoconstrictor to
### keep bleeding to a minimum.
### Our blood vessels are constantly narrowing and widening in
### response to our activity or our environment, constricting in order to
### retain body heat and widening to get rid of excess heat. So when
### we're hot our skin flushes, and when we're very cold we become
### pale. Since the width of the blood vessels affects blood pressure,
### vasoconstrictors are prescribed to treat low blood pressure.
### Vasoconstrictors include antihistamines and amphetamines, as well
### as nicotine and caffeine; we commonly buy them for our runny
### noses and bloodshot eyes as well. The opposite of vasoconstrictors
### are vasodilators, which are commonly used to treat high blood
### pressure.

### Answers

### STRU/STRUCT
### comes from the Latin verb struere, meaning “to put
### together, build, arrange.” A structure is something that's been
### constructed,—that is, built or put together. Instructions tell how the
### pieces should be arranged. Something that obstructs is a barrier
### that's been “built” to stand in your way. And something destructive
### “unbuilds.”

### deconstruction
### Analysis of texts, works of
### art, and cultural patterns that is intended to expose the assumptions
### on which they are based, especially by exposing the limitations of
### language.
### • Deconstruction has been performed on Huckleberry Finn by English
### professors so many times that it's a wonder there's anything left of
### it.
### Deconstruction doesn't actually mean “demolition”; instead it means
### “breaking down” or analyzing something (especially the words in a
### work of fiction or nonfiction) to discover its true significance, which
### is supposedly almost never exactly what the author intended. A
### feminist may deconstruct an old novel to show how even an
### innocent-seeming story somehow depends on the oppression of
### women. A new western may deconstruct the myths of the old West
### and show lawmen as vicious and criminals as flawed but decent.
### Table manners, The Sound of Music, and cosmetics ads have all
### been the subjects of deconstructionist analysis. Of course, not
### everyone agrees with deconstructionist interpretations, and some
### people reject the whole idea of deconstruction, but most of us have
### run into it by now even if we didn't realize it.

### infrastructure
### (1) The underlying foundation
### or basic framework. (2) A system of public works.
### • The public loved her speeches about crime but dozed off when she
### brought up highway repair and infrastructure deterioration.
### Infra- means “below”; so the infrastructure is the “underlying
### structure” of a country and its economy, the fixed installations that it
### needs in order to function. These include roads, bridges, dams, the
### water and sewer systems, railways and subways, airports, and
### harbors. These are generally government-built and publicly owned.
### Some people also speak about such things as the intellectual
### infrastructure or the infrastructure of science research, but the
### meaning of such notions can be extremely vague.

### construe
### (1) To explain the arrangement and meaning
### of words in a sentence. (2) To understand or explain; interpret.
### • She asked how I had construed his last e-mail, and I told her that
### something about it had left me very worried.
### Construe can usually be translated as “interpret.” It's often used in
### law; thus, an Attorney General might construe the term “serious
### injury” in a child-abuse law to include bruises, or a judge might
### construe language about gifts to “heirs” to include spouses. The
### IRS's construal of some of your activities might be different from
### your own—and much more expensive at tax time. Construing is also
### close to translating; so when the British say “public school,” for
### instance, it should be construed or translated as “prep school” in
### American terms.

### instrumental
### (1) Acting as a means, agent, or
### tool. (2) Relating to an instrument, especially a musical instrument.
### • His mother had been instrumental in starting the new arts program
### at the school, for which she was honored at the spring ceremony.
### An instrument is a tool, something used to construct. It's often a tool
### for making music. A musical saw happens to be a carpenter's tool
### that can be played with a violin bow (though you probably wouldn't
### want to play a wrench or a pair of pliers). The musical meanings of
### instrumental, as in “It starts with an instrumental piece” or “a jazz
### instrumental,” are common. But the meanings “helpful,” “useful,” and
### “essential,” as in “He was instrumental in getting my book
### published,” are just as common.

### PROP/PROPRI
### comes from the Latin word proprius, meaning
### “own.” A proprietor is an owner, and property is what he or she
### owns. And the original meaning of proper was “belonging to
### oneself,” so a writer around the year 1400 could say “With his own
### proper sword he was slain,” even if we might not say it quite the
### same way today.

### proprietary
### (1) Relating to an owner or
### proprietor; made or sold by one who has the sole right to do so. (2)
### Privately owned and run as a profit-making organization.
### • The local hospital was a not-for-profit institution, whereas the
### nearby nursing homes were proprietary.
### A proprietary process is a manufacturing process that others are
### forbidden to use, and a proprietary trademark is a name that only
### the owner can use. Legal rights of this kind are ensured by
### copyrights and patents. After a certain period of time, inventions and
### processes lose their legal protection, cease to be proprietary, and
### enter the “public domain,” meaning that everyone can use them
### freely. Baseball fans often take a proprietary attitude toward their
### favorite team—that is, they behave more or less as if they own it,
### even though the only thing they may own is the right to yell from a
### bleacher seat till the end of a game.

### propriety
### (1)
### The
### state
### of
### being
### proper;
### appropriateness. (2) Acting according to what is socially acceptable,
### especially in conduct between the sexes.
### • Propriety used to forbid a young unmarried man and woman to go
### almost anywhere without an adult.
### In an earlier era, when social manners were far more elaborate than
### they are today, propriety and impropriety were words in constant
### use. Today we're more likely to use them in other contexts. We may
### talk about the propriety of government officials' dealings with private
### citizens, the propriety of the relationship between a lawyer and a
### judge, or the impropriety of speaking out of turn in a meeting that
### follows Robert's rules of order. Relations between men and women
### still present questions of propriety, but today it's often in the
### workplace rather than in social settings. Wherever rules, principles,
### and standard procedures have been clearly stated, propriety can
### become an issue. Something improper usually isn't actually illegal,
### but it makes people uncomfortable by giving the impression that
### something isn't quite right.

### appropriate
### (1) To take exclusive possession of,
### often without right. (2) To set apart for a particular purpose or use.
### • It was one of those insulting words that sometimes get
### appropriated by a group that it's meant to insult, which then starts
### using it proudly and defiantly.
### From its roots, the verb appropriate would mean basically “make
### one's own”—that is, “take,” or sometimes “grab.” Each year the
### President and Congress create a budget and appropriate funds for
### each item in it, funds which mostly come in the form of taxes from
### the public. In the House of Representatives, the powerful
### Appropriations Committee often gets the last word on how much
### money goes to each program. “Misappropriation of funds,” on the
### other hand, is a nice way of saying “theft.” If someone appropriated
### pieces of your novel, you might take him or her to court; and if you
### appropriated trade secrets from your former employers, you might
### be the one sued.

### expropriate
### (1) To take away the right of
### possession or ownership. (2) To transfer to oneself.
### • It was only when the country's new government threatened to
### expropriate the American oil refineries that Congress became
### alarmed.
### In ancient Rome, an emperor could condemn a wealthy senator,
### have him killed, and expropriate his property. In 1536 Henry VIII
### declared himself head of the new Church of England and
### expropriated the lands and wealth of the Roman Catholic
### monasteries. And nearly all of North America was expropriated from
### the American Indians, usually without any payment at all. Today,
### democratic governments only carry out legal expropriations, in which
### the owners are properly paid for their land—for example, when a
### highway or other public project needs to be built.

### TORT
### comes from a form of the Latin verb torquere, meaning “to
### twist, wind, or wrench.” In torture, parts of the body may be
### wrenched or twisted or stretched; so those “Indian sunburns” that
### schoolkids give by twisting in different directions on some unlucky
### guy's wrist stay pretty close to torture's original meaning.

### tort
### A wrongful act that does not involve breach of contract
### and for which the injured party can receive damages in a civil action.
### • The manufacturer was almost bankrupted by the massive tort
### actions brought by employees harmed by asbestos.
### Tort came into English straight from French many centuries ago, and
### it still looks a little odd. Its root meaning of “twisted” (as opposed to
### “straight”) obviously came to mean “wrong” (as opposed to “right”).
### Every first-year law student takes a course in the important subject
### of torts. Torts include all the so-called “product-liability” cases,
### against manufacturers of cars, household products, children's toys,
### and so on. They also cover dog bites, slander and libel, and a huge
### variety of other very personal cases of injury, both mental and
### physical—Torts class is never dull. If you're sued for a tort and lose,
### you usually have to pay “damages”—that is, a sum of money—to the
### person who you wronged.

### extort
### To obtain from a person by force, threats, or illegal
### power.
### • She had tried to extort money from a film star, claiming that he
### was the father of her baby.
### To extort is literally to wrench something out of someone. Extortion
### is a mainstay of organized crime. Just as the school bully extorts
### lunch money from the smaller kids in exchange for not beating them
### up, thugs extort “protection” money from business owners with
### threats of violence. But that's only one kind of extortion; a mobster
### might extort favors from a politician with threats of revealing some
### dark secret, just as you might extort a favor from a brother or sister
### by promising not to tell on them.

### contort
### To twist in a violent manner.
### • The governor's explanation of his affair was so contorted that it
### only made matters worse for him.
### Circus contortionists are known for twisting their bodies into
### pretzels; such contortions tend to be easier for females than for
### males, and much easier for the young than for the old. When trying
### to say something uncomfortable or dishonest, people often go
### through verbal contortions. But when someone else “twists”
### something you said or did, we usually say instead that they've
### distorted it.

### tortuous
### (1) Having many twists, bends, or turns;
### winding. (2) Crooked or tricky; involved, complex.
### • The road over the mountains was long and dangerously tortuous,
### and as you rounded the sharp corners you could never see whether
### a huge truck might be barreling down toward you.
### A labyrinth is a tortuous maze. The first labyrinth was built as a
### prison for the monstrous Minotaur, half bull and half man; only by
### holding one end of a thread was the heroic Theseus able to enter
### and slay the Minotaur and then exit. A tortuous problem, a tortuous
### history, and the tortuous path of a bill through Congress all have
### many unexpected twists and turns; a tortuous explanation or
### argument may be too crooked for its own good. Don't confuse
### tortuous with torturous, which means “tortured” or “painfully
### unpleasant”; tortuous has nothing to do with torture.

### VIV
### comes from vivere, the Latin verb meaning “to live or be alive.”
### A survivor has lived through something terrible. A revival brings
### something back to life, whether it's an old film, interest in a long-
### dead novelist, or religious enthusiasm in a group, maybe in a huge
### tent in the countryside.

### vivacious
### Lively in an attractive way.
### • For the cheerleading squad, only the most outgoing, energetic, and
### vivacious of the students get chosen.
### Vivacious can be used to describe a piece of music or writing, but it's
### generally used today to describe people, and particularly women.
### The main female characters in Shakespeare's plays—Beatrice in
### Much Ado About Nothing, Rosalind in As You Like It, and Portia in
### The Merchant of Venice, for example—are often full of humor, spirit,
### and vivacity.

### bon vivant
### A sociable person with a love of
### excellent food and drink.
### • My uncle and aunt were bons vivants, and could usually be found
### in the evening at a swank midtown bar surrounded by a crowd of
### tipsy merrymakers.
### Bon vivant comes straight from French, where it means literally
### “good liver,” and is still pronounced in the French way, though we've
### actually been using it in English since the 17th century. A proper bon
### vivant has some money and lots of friends and plenty of style and
### knows a good wine and can tell a great story and loves to laugh.
### Because of all these requirements, true bons vivants are rather rare
### —but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of people who hope to
### be one someday.

### revivify
### To give new life to; bring back to life.
### • All their efforts to revivify the boys' club seemed to be getting
### them nowhere, till one of the board members had a great idea.
### Worn-out soil may be revivified by careful organic tending. A terrific
### new recruit can revivify a discouraged football team, and an
### imaginative and energetic new principal can revivify a failing high
### school. After World War II, one European country after another was
### slowly revivified, their economies and cultural life gradually coming
### back to life. Notice that revivify looks like some other words with
### very similar meanings, such as revive, revitalize, and reinvigorate.

### vivisection
### Operation on living animals, often for
### experimental purposes.
### • The lab attempts to avoid vivisection in its research, concentrating
### instead on alternative methods that have been developed.
### Vivisection includes the Latin root sect, meaning “cut.” The Greek
### physician Galen, who lived during the 2nd century A.D., practiced
### vivisection on live monkeys and dogs to learn such things as the role
### of the spinal cord in muscle activity and whether veins and arteries
### carry air or blood; his findings formed the basis of medical practice
### for more than a thousand years. Vivisection continues to be used in
### drug and medical research today, but often in secret, since it makes
### most people very uncomfortable and some groups are violently
### opposed to it.

### SERV
### means “to be subject to.” A servant is the person who serves
### you with meals and provides other necessary services. A tennis or
### volleyball serve puts the ball in play, much as a servant puts food on
### the table.

### serviceable
### (1) Helpful or useful. (2) Usable.
### • In the attic they found some chairs and a table, which, with a new
### coat of paint, became quite serviceable for informal get-togethers.
### Someone who speaks serviceable Spanish isn't fluent in it but gets
### by pretty well. A serviceable jacket is practical and maybe even
### rugged. But serviceable sometimes damns with faint praise. A
### serviceable performance is all right but not inspired. Serviceable
### curtains aren't the ideal color or pattern, but they serve their
### purpose. A serviceable pair of shoes is sturdy but won't win you any
### fashion points.

### servile
### (1) Suitable to a servant. (2) Humbly submissive.
### • The dog's manner was servile, and it lacked a healthy
### independence.
### During the Middle Ages, most of the farming was done by a servile
### class known as serfs, who enjoyed hardly any personal freedom.
### This began to change in the 14th century; but the Russian serfs
### weren't freed until the 1860s, when the servile class in the U.S. was
### also freed. But servile today usually refers to a personal manner; a
### person who shows servility usually isn't a servant, but simply seems
### too eager to please and seems to lack self-respect.

### servitude
### A state or condition of slavery or bondage
### to another.
### • She spent an entire summer working at a resort under conditions
### that felt like utter servitude.
### Servitude is slavery or anything resembling it. The entire black
### population of colonial America lived in permanent servitude. And
### millions of the whites who populated this country arrived in
### “indentured servitude,” obliged to pay off the cost of their journey
### with several years of labor. Servitude comes in many forms, of
### course: in the bad old days of the British navy, it was said that the
### difference between going to sea and going to jail was that you were
### less likely to drown in jail.

### subservient
### (1) Serving or useful in an inferior
### situation or capacity. (2) Slavishly obedient.
### • Many have wondered why Congress always seems subservient to
### the financial industry, supporting it even when the voters are angrily
### calling for reforms.
### Since sub- means “below,” it emphasizes the lower position of the
### person in the subservient one. Soldiers of a given rank are always
### subservient to those of a higher rank; this subservience is
### symbolized by the requirement that they salute their superior at
### every opportunity. Women have often been forced into subservient
### relationships with men. A small nation may feel subservient to its
### more powerful neighbor, obliged to obey even when it doesn't want
### to. So subservience usually brings with it a good dose of resentment.

### CLUS
### comes from the Latin claudere, “to close.” Words based on the
### Latin verb often have forms in which the d becomes an s. So, for
### example, include, which once meant “to shut up or enclose” and
### now means “to contain,” has the related word inclusive, which
### means “including everything.”

### occlusion
### An obstruction or blockage; the act of
### obstructing or closing off.
### • The doctors worry that a loosened piece of plaque from the artery
### wall could lead to an occlusion of a brain artery, resulting in a stroke.
### Occlusion, formed with the prefix ob-, here meaning “in the way,”
### occurs when something has been closed up or blocked off. Almost all
### heart attacks are the result of the occlusion of a coronary (heart)
### artery by a blood clot, and many strokes are caused by an occlusion
### in an artery serving the brain. When a person's upper and lower
### teeth form a malocclusion, they close incorrectly or badly. An
### occlusion, or occluded front, happens when a fast-moving cold front
### overtakes a slow-moving warm front and slides underneath it, lifting
### the warm air and blocking its movement.

### exclusive
### (1) Not shared; available to only one person
### or group, especially those from a high social class. (2) Full and
### complete.
### • That technology is exclusive to one cell-phone manufacturer, but
### some of the others are dying to use it.
### In words such as expel, export, and exclusive, the prefix ex- means
### “out of, outside.” Thus, to exclude means basically to close the door
### in order to keep someone or something out. When the word appears
### in an advertisement, it's often making an appeal to snobs. An
### “exclusive” offer is supposedly made to only a few people; not so
### many years ago, “exclusive” housing developments excluded those
### of a certain race or color. If a product is being sold exclusively by
### one store, you won't be able to find it anywhere else. When a
### newspaper or news show has an exclusive, it's a story that no one
### else has yet reported. Exclusive's antonym is inclusive; an inclusive
### policy, an inclusive church, or an inclusive approach is one that aims
### to include as many people as possible.

### recluse
### A person who lives withdrawn from society.
### • The lonely farmhouse was home to a middle-aged recluse, a
### stooped, bearded man who would never answer the door when
### someone knocked.
### Greta Garbo and Howard Hughes were two of the most famously
### reclusive celebrities of modern times. She had been a great
### international star, called the most beautiful woman in the world; he
### had been an aircraft manufacturer and film producer, with one of the
### greatest fortunes in the world. It seems that Garbo's reclusiveness
### resulted from her desire to leave her public with only the youthful
### image of her face. Hughes was terrified of germs, though that was
### the least of his problems.

### seclusion
### (1) A screening or hiding from view. (2) A
### place that is isolated or hidden.
### • The police immediately placed him in seclusion in a hospital room,
### with armed guards at the door.
### With its prefix se-, “apart,” seclusion has the basic meaning of a
### place or condition that's “closed away.” A lone island may be
### secluded, and its seclusion might be what its owner prizes most
### about it. Presidents and their staffs may go into seclusion before
### making critical decisions. Monastery life is purposely secluded, and
### monks may have taken vows to live lives of seclusion. The deadly
### brown recluse spider prefers seclusion but is sometimes disturbed by
### very unlucky people.

## Greek and Latin Borrowings
### acme
### Highest point; summit, peak.
### • Last Saturday's upset victory over Michigan may prove to have
### been the acme of the entire season.
### In Greek, acme meant a mountain peak, but in English we hardly
### ever use it in the physical sense. Instead we speak of someone's
### new job as the acme of her career, or of a certain leap as the acme
### of classical dance technique. In old Road Runner cartoons, the Acme
### Company is the provider of every ingenious device imaginable. But
### the word can't always be taken quite literally as a brand or company
### name; it's possible, for instance, that something called the Acme Bar
### & Grill may not be the absolutely highest and best example of a bar
### and grill. And don't confuse acme with acne, the skin disorder—even
### though both actually come from the same word.

### catharsis
### A cleansing or purification of the body,
### emotions, or spirit.
### • Having broken down sobbing at the funeral, he said afterwards
### that it had felt like a catharsis.
### One of the earliest uses of catharsis is in Aristotle's Poetics, where
### the philosopher claims that watching a tragedy provides the
### spectators with a desirable catharsis because of the buildup and
### release of the emotions of pity and fear. Sigmund Freud borrowed
### the term as a name for the process of bringing a set of unconscious
### desires and ideas back into consciousness in order to eliminate their
### bad effects. Today some people claim it's cathartic to merely express
### your anger or grief, since it “gets it out of your system.” Laxatives
### are also called cathartic, since they provide a physical catharsis that
### some people believe to be healthful. But there's no general
### agreement about any of this, and the notion of catharsis remains a
### very personal one.

### colossus
### (1) A gigantic statue. (2) A person or thing
### that resembles such a statue in size or activity or influence.
### • Even if Citizen Kane had been his only movie, Orson Welles would
### be regarded as a colossus in the history of film.
### The original colossi (notice the plural form) were the larger-than-life
### statues made by the Greeks and Romans. The most famous of these
### was the Colossus of Rhodes, a statue of the sun god Helios built on
### the Greek island of Rhodes around 280 B.C. that was over 100 feet
### tall and took more than 12 years to build. The Statue of Liberty is a
### modern colossus, enormous and stately, at the entrance to New York
### Harbor. And someone who has played a colossal role in history, such
### as Winston Churchill, may be called a colossus as well.

### detritus
### Loose material that results from disintegration;
### debris.
### • The base of the cliff was littered with the detritus of centuries of
### erosion.
### After the first hard freeze of fall, gardens are sadly littered with the
### detritus of the summer's plants and produce: stalks, leaves, vines,
### rotted vegetables, and maybe even a hand trowel left behind. As the
### flooding Mississippi River retreats back to its ordinary course, it
### leaves detritus behind in its wake, debris gathered from everywhere
### by the raging waters. The detritus of civilization may include
### junkyards and abandoned buildings; mental detritus may includes all
### kinds of useless trivia. Notice how this word is pronounced; for some
### reason, people often try to accent the first syllable rather than the
### second.

### hoi polloi
### The general population; the masses.
### • He's a terrible snob, the kind of person who thinks it's funny to say
### things like “the riffraff” and “the hoi polloi” and “the great
### unwashed.”
### In Greek, hoi polloi means simply “the many.” (Even though hoi itself
### means “the,” in English we almost always say “the hoi polloi.”) It
### comes originally from the famous Funeral Oration by Pericles, where
### it was actually used in a positive way. Today it's generally used by
### people who think of themselves as superior—though it's also
### sometimes used in Pericles' democratic spirit. By the way, it has no
### relation to hoity-toity, meaning “stuck-up,” which starts with the
### same sound but has nothing to do with Greek.

### kudos
### (1) Fame and renown that result from an
### achievement; prestige. (2) Praise.
### • His first film earned him kudos at the independent film festivals,
### and the big studios were soon calling him up.
### Kudos is an odd word in English. In Greek, kydos meant “glory” or
### “prestige”; in other words, it wasn't something you could count. But
### in English kudos looks like a plural and is therefore often treated as
### one. So people now sometimes use the form kudo, with kudos as its
### plural.

### onus
### A disagreeable necessity or obligation; responsibility.
### • Now that Congress has passed the bill, the onus is on the
### President to live up to his promise and sign it into law.
### In Latin onus means literally a “burden,” like a particularly heavy
### backpack. But in English an onus is more often a burden of
### responsibility or blame. In legal language, the onus probandi is the
### “burden of proof,” meaning the big job of assembling enough
### evidence to prove a person's guilt, since the accused is innocent
### until proved guilty.

### stigma
### A mark of shame: stain.
### • In these small villages, the stigma of pregnancy is a terrible thing
### for an unmarried girl.
### In Greek and Latin, a stigma was a mark or brand, especially one
### that marked a slave, so a stigma marked a person as inferior. When
### the plural form stigmata is used, it usually refers to the nail wounds
### on Christ's hands and feet, wounds which have sometimes
### reappeared on the hands or feet of later worshippers such as St.
### Francis. When stigma began to be used in English, it usually meant
### the kind of mark or stain you can't actually see. So today we hear
### about the stigma of homelessness, the stigma of overweight, and
### the stigma of mental illness. People may be so afraid of being
### stigmatized for losing a job that they'll put on their office clothes and
### drive out their driveways every weekday morning so that the
### neighbors won't know.
