### MEDI
### comes from the Latin medius, meaning “middle.” Our word
### medium refers to something in a middle position. The medieval
### period of European history, also known as the Middle Ages, is the
### period between Greek and Roman antiquity and the “modern age.”
### But why people around 1620 began to use the term “Middle Ages,”
### because they regarded themselves as modern, is an interesting
### question.

### median
### In the middle; especially, having a value that is
### in the middle of a series of values arranged from smallest to largest.
### • The city's west side is well-off but its east side isn't, so the city's
### median house prices are typical for the region.
### People often use the word average without realizing that there are
### two common forms of average. Suppose you want to find the
### average net worth of a group of people—that is, the average value
### of everything they possess. To find one type of average, called the
### mean, you'd simply add up the total value of money and property of
### everyone in the group and divide it by the number of people. To find
### the other type, called the median, you'd identify the net worth of the
### person who is richer than half the people and poorer than the other
### half. So if Warren Buffett drove through a tiny village in India, the
### mean net worth of those in the village would suddenly rise to
### perhaps a billion dollars, but their median net worth would remain
### close to zero. Which figure would be more meaningful?

### mediate
### (1) To work with opposing sides in an
### argument or dispute in order to get an agreement. (2) To achieve a
### settlement or agreement by working with the opposing sides.
### • He was the third person who had attempted to mediate the
### dispute between the firm and its striking workers, the first two
### having given up in despair.
### Mediation is often used in disputes between companies and labor
### unions, and the government actually provides mediators for such
### disagreements. The mediator tries to bring the two sides to an
### agreement, but doesn't have the power to actually order such an
### agreement. Mediators also sometimes have a role in international
### disputes; when two neighboring countries claim exclusive fishing
### rights in the same ocean waters, for example, they may invite a
### trained mediator to help settle the argument. Arbitration is similar to
### mediation, but in arbitration both parties in a dispute agree to accept
### the arbitrator's decision.

### intermediary
### A person who works with
### opposing sides in a dispute in order to bring about an agreement.
### • The divorce had been bitter, and the two now communicated only
### through an old friend who they both trusted as an intermediary.
### Since inter- means “between, among” (see
### INTER
### ), an intermediary
### is someone who moves back and forth in the middle area between
### two sides—a “go-between.” Mediator (which shares the medi- root)
### is often a synonym, and so is facilitator; broker and agent are often
### others. Thus, a real-estate broker or agent shuttles between a
### house's buyer and seller, who may never even meet each other.
### Financial intermediation is what happens when you put money in a
### bank or investment firm, which then invests it in various companies;
### if you want, you can instead cut out the intermediary and invest the
### money directly in companies of your own choosing.

### mediocrity
### The quality of being not very good.
### • He's the kind of person who can get depressed by the mediocrity
### of a dinner, or even a wine.
### People interested in words always point out that mediocrity doesn't
### mean quite what its main root would indicate: Why doesn't it
### describe something that's right in the middle of the pack, exactly
### what you would expect? Instead the words mediocrity and mediocre
### always suggest disappointment. A mediocre play is one you wish you
### hadn't wasted an evening on, and the mediocre actor in it should
### probably find another profession. A person can even be called a
### mediocrity, though it isn't very nice and you'd never do it to his face.

### OID
### comes from the Greek word for “appearance” or “form.” Since
### aster in ancient Greek meant “star,” the small bodies orbiting
### between Mars and Jupiter that looked like stars through primitive
### telescopes were called asteroids. A factoid is a little bit of
### information that looks like a fact, whether it is or not. And some
### people these days will attach -oid to just about anything; you can
### probably figure out the meaning of nutsoid, nerdoid, and freakazoid
### without much help.

### rhomboid
### In geometry, a shape with four sides where
### only the opposite sides and angles are equal.
### • The flimsy picture frame had been damaged en route, and its
### rectangular shape was now a rhomboid.
### Rhomboids, like triangles, may take various different shapes, but
### they always look like a lopsided diamond or rectangle. As both a
### noun and an adjective, rhomboid can be applied to anything with
### those shapes, such as certain muscles of the upper back when
### viewed from behind. Whenever you hear about rhomboid exercises,
### rhomboid strain, or rhomboid pain, it involves those muscles, which
### attach your shoulder blades to your spine and can be strained by
### carrying a heavy backpack, serving a tennis ball, or just slumping in
### your chair in front of a computer all day.

### deltoid
### A large muscle of the shoulder.
### • In Anatomy class she had learned about the deltoids, which her
### trainer at the gym just called “delts.”
### The fourth letter of the Greek alphabet is delta, and a capital delta is
### triangle-shaped. In English, delta commonly means the sand
### deposits that form a huge triangle at the mouth of certain large
### rivers. Deltoid as an adjective means “having a triangular shape,”
### and botanists often use the word to describe the shape of certain
### leaves. The triangular, swept-back wings seen on jet fighter aircraft
### are called delta wings. Your deltoid muscles—not far from your
### rhomboids—form a cap on your shoulders, and some gym trainers
### even treat shoulder and deltoid as synonyms. Can you guess the
### general shape of deltoids when seen from the side?

### dendroid
### Resembling a tree in form.
### • The reef was a fantastic jungle, its dendroid corals resembling
### luminous, poisonous trees in a landscape of bizarre beauty.
### Dendrology is the study of trees, and those who do the studying are
### called dendrologists. So dendroid describes something that
### “branches” in all directions from a central “trunk” in an irregular way.
### The word is almost always used by biologists, who often speak of
### dendroid seaweeds, dendroid moss, and dendroid algae.

### humanoid
### Looking or acting like a human.
### • We slowly learn that most of Dr. Bennell's friends have been
### replaced by humanoid substitutes that have emerged from pods.
### A humanoid robot, sometimes called an android, is a robot that
### resembles a human. Accounts of the yeti, Sasquatch, and Bigfoot
### continue to fascinate us mainly because of their humanoid
### characteristics. The idea of creating a monstrous humanoid, such as
### the Jewish golem or Victor Frankenstein's creation, has intrigued us
### for centuries. “Humanoid Animation” is a standard for creating
### humanlike figures for video that lets the same figure be used in a
### variety of 3-D games—some of which have nothing but humanoids
### for characters.

### SCOP
### , which usually appears in a suffix, comes from the Greek
### skopein, meaning “to look at.” In English we have the simple noun
### scope, along with some other words it sometimes stands for:
### telescope, microscope, periscope, and so on. And have you ever
### used a stereoscope, a device your great-grandparents probably
### enjoyed, which lets you look through a viewer at two slightly
### different photographs of the same thing, one with each eye, to enjoy
### the illusion that you're seeing it in three dimensions?

### endoscope
### A lighted tubular medical instrument for
### viewing the interior or a hollow organ or body part that typically has
### one or more channels to permit passage of surgical instruments.
### • Possible uses of the endoscope outside of medicine soon became
### apparent, and soon mechanics were using specially designed
### endoscopes to view the insides of jet engines.
### The Greek prefix endo- means “within, inside,” so around 1860 an
### early crude instrument for looking deep inside the body was named
### the endoscope. But modern endoscopy required the invention of the
### electric lightbulb and then fiber-optic cable, so the first modern
### endoscopes date only to 1967. An endoscope may be inserted
### through a natural passageway (for example, through the nose or
### down the esophagus) or through a tiny cut in the skin. A tiny camera
### with a light at the end of the cable sends back images onto a screen,
### and the surgeon uses special instruments that work through a tube
### alongside the cable. There are now specialized types of endoscopes
### for every part of the body, where they can take tissue samples, cut
### out small growths, or remove foreign objects.

### arthroscopic
### Relating to a fiber-optic instrument
### that is inserted through an incision near a joint to examine the
### joint's interior.
### • The day he scheduled the fourth arthroscopic operation on his
### knee was the day he decided to hang up his football cleats.
### In Greek, arthron means “joint.” Arthritis is a condition of swollen
### and painful joints, and arthropods are animals (including insects,
### arachnids, and crustaceans) that have a segmented body and
### jointed
### limbs.
### Arthroscopic
### surgery,
### or
### arthroscopy,
### has
### revolutionized the treatment of joint injuries. It's performed with an
### arthroscope, a specialized type of endoscope (see above). A tiny
### camera and a light are inserted through a small cut in the skin, and
### through another cut nearby a tiny surgical instrument, controlled
### through its own cable, is inserted. The surgeon then performs the
### operation, guided by the images sent back via the fiber-optic cable.
### Most patients walk out of the hospital on crutches the same day,
### though full recovery may take a couple of months.

### laparoscopy
### Examination of the interior of the
### abdomen using a fiber-optic instrument inserted through a cut in the
### abdomen's wall.
### • The initial laparoscopy involves inserting the cable through a tiny
### cut and inflating the internal area with carbon dioxide so that a
### good-sized area will become visible.
### Since laparo- means “wall of the abdomen,” a laparoscope is an
### endoscope designed especially to examine the abdomen. Common
### laparoscopic surgeries include removal of the gallbladder, appendix,
### or kidney, and removal of tumors from abdominal organs. Like the
### other endoscopic surgeries, laparoscopy, as compared to traditional
### surgery, reduces risk of bleeding, pain following the operation,
### patient recovery time, and length of hospital stays.

### oscilloscope
### An instrument that shows visual
### images of changing electrical current on a screen.
### • An oscilloscope next to the bed was monitoring her vital signs, but
### otherwise it was hard for a visitor to be sure she was even alive.
### In Latin oscillare means “to swing,” and our word oscillation usually
### means “vibration” or “variation,” especially in a changing flow of
### electricity. The oscilloscope basically draws a graph of an electrical
### signal. Since all kinds of physical phenomena can be converted into
### an electric voltage, oscilloscopes can be used to measure such
### things as sound, light, and heat. So an oscilloscope can analyze how
### one clarinet's sound is different from another's, or how one bulb's
### light differs from another's. Auto mechanics use oscilloscopes to
### measure engine vibrations; doctors use them to measure brain
### waves. Audio technicians use oscilloscopes to diagnose problems in
### audio equipment; TV and radio technicians use them to diagnose TV
### and radio problems. But oscilloscopes are most essential today to
### high-tech electronics experimentation.

### TRANS
### comes from Latin to indicate movement “through, across, or
### beyond” something. Translation carries a writer's meaning from one
### language to another. A television signal is sent or transmitted
### through the air (or a cable) to your set. When making your way
### through a city on public transportation, you may have to transfer
### from one bus or subway to another.

### transient
### (1) Not lasting long; short-lived. (2)
### Passing through a place and staying only briefly.
### • It's a college town, so much of its population is transient.
### A transient mood is one that passes quickly. A brief stopover in a
### town on your way to somewhere else is a transient visit. A summer
### job on a farm is transient work, lasting only as long as the growing
### season. You may occasionally experience a transient episode of
### dizziness or weakness, which vanishes without a trace. As a noun,
### transient means a person who passes through a place, staying only
### briefly. The hoboes and tramps of earlier years were some of our
### most colorful transients, known for hopping freight trains,
### panhandling on the street, and stealing homemade pies cooling on
### the windowsill.

### transfiguration
### A change in form or
### appearance; a glorifying spiritual change.
### • Being in love caused a complete transfiguration of her personality.
### The Gospels relate that one day Jesus took three disciples up a
### mountain, where they witnessed his transfiguration into divine form:
### his face shone like the sun, his garments became brilliantly white,
### and a voice from heaven proclaimed that this was the son of God.
### Transfiguration was first used in English as the name of this biblical
### event, and the Feast of the Transfiguration remains the name of a
### holy day. So the word has always kept a somewhat religious—and
### almost always positive—tone. A face may be transfigured by joy, and
### an “ugly duckling” may be slowly transfigured into a radiant beauty.
### And as Harry Potter fans know, transfiguration is a subject long
### taught at the Hogwarts School by Minerva McGonagall.

### transponder
### A radio or radar set that emits a
### radio signal after receiving such a signal.
### • When a patient is admitted to an emergency room, an implanted
### transponder can relay important data about his or her medical
### history.
### This word was coined during World War II by simply joining pieces
### of the words transmitter and responder. Transponders are basic to
### modern aviation and communications satellites, and they're finding
### new uses in fields such as medicine as well. But they're now also
### part of everyday life. The “E-ZPass” that lets you drive right through
### turnpike tollbooths is a transponder, and the car you're driving may
### not even start unless it recognizes the signal from your personal
### key's transponder. In a big crowded foot race, you may carry a tiny
### transponder on your shoe that records when you cross both the
### starting line and the finish line.

### transcendent
### (1) Exceeding or rising above usual
### limits; supreme. (2) Beyond comprehension; beyond ordinary
### experience or material existence.
### • Despite the chaos around her she remained calm, with a
### transcendent smile on her face.
### The Latin verb scandere means “to climb,” so transcend has the
### basic meaning of climbing so high that you cross some boundary. A
### transcendent experience is one that takes you out of yourself and
### convinces you of a larger life or existence; in this sense, it means
### something close to “spiritual.” The American writers and thinkers
### known as the Transcendentalists, including Ralph Waldo Emerson
### and Henry David Thoreau, believed in the unity of all creation, the
### basic goodness of humankind, and the superiority of spiritual vision
### over mere logic. When we speak of the transcendent importance of
### an issue such as climate change, we may mean that everything else
### on earth actually depends on it.

### Answers

### PRO
### is an important prefix, with a couple of quite different broad
### meanings. In this section, we'll look at words in which pro- has the
### basic meaning “for” or “favoring.” Everyone knows words like pro-
### democracy and pro-American, but other pro- words may not be quite
### so self-explanatory.

### proactive
### Acting in anticipation of future problems,
### needs, or changes.
### • Our president prides himself on being proactive, and is always
### imagining situations the company might be facing in three or four
### years.
### People who tend to react to a problem only when it's gotten serious
### could be called reactive people. Until recently, reactive (in this sense)
### didn't really have an antonym. So proactive was coined to describe
### the kind of person who's always looking into the future in order to
### be prepared for anything. A good parent attempts to be proactive on
### behalf of his or her children, trying to imagine the problems they
### might be facing in a few months or years. A company's financial
### officers study the patterns of the company's earnings to make sure it
### won't risk running short of cash at any point in the next year or two.
### Proactive has only been around a few decades, and it can still
### sometimes sound like a fashionable buzzword.

### pro bono
### Being, involved in, or doing professional
### work, and especially legal work, donated for the public good.
### • The law firm allows her to do several hours of pro bono work every
### week, and she devotes it to helping poor immigrant families.
### In Latin, pro bono publico means “for the public good”; in English
### we generally shorten the phrase to pro bono. Donating free legal
### help to those who need it has long been a practice of American law
### firms; the American Bar Association actually recommends that all
### lawyers donate 50 hours a year. Pro bono work is sometimes
### donated by nonlegal firms as well. For example, an advertising firm
### might produce a 60-second video for an environmental or
### educational organization, or a strategic-planning firm might prepare
### a start-up plan for a charity that funds shelters for battered women.

### proponent
### One who argues in favor of something:
### advocate.
### • The new governor is a proponent of a longer school year, and he's
### gotten a lot of support from parents.
### Proponent comes from the same Latin word as propose, so a
### proponent is someone who proposes something, or at least supports
### it by speaking and writing in favor of it. Thus, for example,
### proponents of casinos argue that they create jobs, whereas
### proponents of a casino ban—that is, casino opponents—argue that
### they're corrupting and they take money away from people who can't
### afford it. As a rule, just about anything important that gets proposed
### also gets opposed.

### pro forma
### Done or existing as something that is
### required but that has little true meaning or importance.
### • The letter she received from him after her husband's death struck
### her as pro forma, and she knew the old friendship between the two
### men had never really been repaired.
### A lot of things are done for the sake of appearances. A teacher
### might get officially observed and evaluated every three years, even
### though everyone knows she's terrific and the whole thing is strictly
### pro forma. A critic might say that a orchestral conductor gave a pro
### forma performance, since his heart wasn't in it. A business owner
### might make a pro forma appearance at the funeral of a politician's
### mother, never having met her but maybe hoping for a favor from her
### son sometime in the future. In business, pro forma has some special
### meanings; a pro forma invoice, for example, will list all the items
### being sent but, unlike a true invoice, won't be an actual bill.

### PRO
### , in its other broad meaning, means “before, in front of.” So, for
### example, to proceed means “to move out in front”; to progress
### means to “to move forward”; and somebody prominent stands out,
### as if he or she were actually standing out in front of the crowd.

### protrude
### To jut out from the surrounding surface or
### context.
### • As he leaned over, she noticed something protruding from under
### his jacket, and realized with a sickening feeling that he was armed.
### Since trudere means “to thrust” in Latin, protrude means basically
### “to thrust forward.” If your neighbors' patio protrudes over your
### property boundary, you may want to discuss it with them. A
### protruding disc in your spine may have to be operated on sooner or
### later; superficial protrusions, such as corns or bunions, tend to be
### less serious than more deeply rooted ones.

### prophylaxis
### Measures designed to preserve
### health and prevent the spread of disease.
### • For rabies, prophylaxis in the form of vaccines for cats and dogs is
### much better than treating them after being bitten.
### In Greek, phylax means “guard,” so prophylactic measures guard
### against disease by taking action ahead of time. Thus, for example,
### before the polio vaccine became available, prophylaxis against polio
### included avoiding crowds and public swimming pools. These days a
### well-known kind of prophylactic is used to prevent sexually
### transmitted diseases; but prophylactic measures only work when
### people use them.

### promulgate
### (1) To proclaim or make public. (2) To
### put (a law) into effect.
### • The country's new constitution was officially promulgated in a
### grand ceremony at the presidential palace.
### All laws need to be made public in some way so that citizens may
### know if they're in danger of breaking them. Since they can't be
### expected to go into effect until the population knows they exist,
### promulgate has the two meanings “proclaim” and “put into effect.”
### In ancient Greece and Rome, when most people couldn't read, a
### new written law would actually be proclaimed in a public place;
### we've all seen such scenes in historical movies. But today
### promulgation of a law generally occurs simply by its being published
### in an official government publication and on a government Web site.
### New laws are also often reported in newspapers and on TV, though
### rarely in complete form.

### prologue
### (1) An introduction to a literary work. (2) An
### introductory event or development.
### • The Boston Tea Party of 1773 turned out to be a prologue to the
### American Revolution.
### In ancient Greek drama, the prologos (a word that means basically
### “speaking before”) was the opening portion of the play, before the
### entry of the all-important chorus. It might be spoken by a single
### actor, maybe playing a god, who would “set the scene” for the
### audience. Playwrights today instead often provide the same kind of
### “scene-setting” information through dialogue near the play's
### beginning; in movies, it may appear (as in the “Star Wars” series) in
### the form of actual written text. In a nonfiction book, the lead-in is
### now usually called a preface or introduction; novels rarely provide
### any introduction at all. Still, prologue remains a useful word for
### nonliterary purposes. The saying “The past is prologue” tells us that,
### in real life, almost everything can be a prologue to what follows it.

### Answers

### RE
### is a prefix which, like pro- (see
### PRO
### ), has more than one
### meaning. In this section, we'll focus on the meaning “again.” We use
### re- words with this meaning every day—redo, reheat, recheck,
### reread, resell, repaint, etc.—and we feel free to make up new ones
### as needed. But in plenty of other re- words, the meaning isn't so
### obvious.

### remorse
### A deep regret arising from a sense of guilt for
### past wrongs.
### • Remorse for the accident that occurred that night seems to have
### altered the course of the senator's life.
### In Latin, mordere means “to bite”; thus, remorse is something that
### “gnaws” at you over and over. In criminal court, judges are always
### looking for signs that a convicted felon is suffering remorse for his
### crime; if not, the judge may well lengthen his sentence or deny him
### parole after serving part of it. Remorse is stronger than mere regret;
### real remorse is the kind of thing that may last a lifetime.

### reiterate
### To state or do over again or repeatedly.
### • At the end of every class, Professor Lewis reiterates that we should
### get an early start on our term papers.
### In Latin, iterum means “again,” so reiterate has the basic meaning of
### “repeat over and over.” Our word iteration is used a lot by computer
### programmers today, often meaning a repeated response to program
### instructions that gets something closer to its final form, but also
### often meaning a new version of something, such as a program. But
### a reiteration is simply a repeat or several repeats.

### rejuvenate
### To make young or youthful again; to give
### new vigor to.
### • He was in bad shape after his wife's death, but everyone says he's
### been rejuvenated by his remarriage.
### Juvenis, Latin for “young,” can be seen in a word such as juvenile.
### Rejuvenation is something that can be carried out on a creaky old
### house, a clunker of a car, a sluggish career, a weak economy, or a
### company that's lost its edge, but rejuvenate and rejuvenation are
### probably used most often for talking about our physical selves. Ads
### for lotions promise skin rejuvenation; diet-book covers show
### rejuvenated (or maybe just young) models bursting with health. We
### still seem to be searching for that “Fuente de la Juventud” that Juan
### Ponce de León failed to discover five hundred years ago.

### reconcile
### (1) To make agree. (2) To make friendly
### again.
### • Now she has to reconcile her liking for her brother-in-law with the
### news that he was picked up for armed robbery last week.
### In Latin, conciliare means “to calm, soothe”; thus, reconcile means
### essentially “to calm again.” Warring friends can often be reconciled
### by a nice note or apology. When you're faced with two things that
### don't square very well, you may have to reconcile them, the way a
### scientist might try to reconcile the differing results from two research
### projects. The U.S. House and Senate, in a process called
### reconciliation, try to produce one final bill from two different versions
### that they've passed separately. To reconcile yourself to something
### means to get used to it; thus, you may need to reconcile yourself to
### not getting to the beach next summer, or you may have reconciled
### yourself to the idea of your daughter in the Peace Corps marrying a
### Mongolian goat herder.

### RE-
### , in its other main sense, means “back” or backward.” Since
### doing something again means going back to it, the two senses are
### actually related; still, the meaning of re- in most words is pretty
### clearly one or the other. So a rebound comes back at you; to recall
### means to “call back” a memory; and to react is to “act back” at
### someone else's action.

### reciprocal
### (1) Done, given, or felt equally by both
### sides. (2) Related to each other in such a way that one completes
### the other or is the equal of the other.
### • They had done us a great favor, so as a reciprocal gesture we
### invited them for a weekend on the island.
### In Latin, reciprocus means “returning the same way” or
### “alternating.” So in a reciprocating engine, like the one in your car,
### the pistons move back and forth, and that motion is transformed
### into the rotary motion of the crankshaft. A reciprocal is a pair of
### numbers (such as 5/6 and 6/5) that can be multiplied to produce 1.
### Reciprocity (with the accent on the third syllable) between two
### nations means they agree to recognize certain things granted in one
### country as being valid in the other—for example, your driver's
### license.

### rebut
### (1) To oppose by argument. (2) To prove to be
### wrong.
### • The claims about receiving payoffs from builders were eventually
### rebutted by the mayor's office, but the damage had been done.
### The -but in rebut once meant basically “butt,” so rebut's original
### meanings were “to drive or beat back” and “to attack with violent
### language.” Rebuttals can still be rather violent, as anyone who has
### watched some heated moments in a presidential debate can testify.
### The word is often used by lawyers, since the lawyer for the accused
### or for the party being sued almost always tries to rebut the charges
### against his or her client; but it's also used in plenty of contexts
### outside the courtroom.

### revoke
### To officially cancel the power or effect of something
### (such as a law, order, or privilege).
### • His real-estate license had been revoked after his conviction for
### fraud three years earlier.
### Since vocare means “to call” in Latin (see
### VOC
### ), to revoke is to “call
### back.” Your driver's license could be revoked after about three
### convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol; some people's
### licenses are even revoked for life. You could get your passport
### revoked if a judge thought you had violated the terms of your bail
### and suspected you might skip the country. And if you're out of prison
### on probation and violate the terms of probation, it will probably be
### revoked and you'll end up back in the slammer.

### regress
### To return to an earlier and usually worse or less
### developed condition or state.
### • In the years since she had left, the country seemed to have
### regressed badly, and its corruption and dire poverty had gotten
### much harder to ignore.
### As you might guess, regress is the opposite of progress. So if a
### disease regresses, that's generally a good thing, but in most other
### ways we prefer not to regress. If someone's mental state has been
### improving, we hope he or she won't start to regress; and when a
### nation's promising educational system begins to regress, that's a bad
### sign for the country's future. Economists often distinguish between a
### progressive tax and a regressive tax; in a progressive tax, the
### percentage that goes to taxes gets larger as the amount of money
### being taxed gets larger, while in a regressive tax the percentage gets
### smaller. (Rich people prefer regressive taxes.)

### Answers

### DERM
### comes from the Greek derma, meaning “skin.” For medical
### advice on a skin problem such as acne, we may go to a
### dermatologist, or skin specialist. When we get a shot, it's usually
### with a hypodermic, a needle that goes “under the skin” (see
### HYP/HYPO
### ). A pachyderm is a “thick-skinned” animal, which most of
### us just call an elephant.

### dermal
### Relating to the skin and especially to the dermis.
### • The agency is always studying what can be done to prevent
### dermal exposure to chemicals in the workplace.
### The word dermal often comes up nowadays in connection with
### cosmetic treatments. Dermal therapy usually means restoring
### moisture to dry, cracked skin. Dermal fillers such as collagen can be
### injected to fill in acne scars or reduce wrinkles. These have now
### been joined by treatments like Botox, which paralyzes facial dermal
### muscles, again in order to reduce wrinkles (since those dermal
### muscles are used to form expressions). A synonym for dermal is
### cutaneous.

### epidermis
### The outer layer of the skin.
### • The epidermis is the body's first line of defense against infection,
### external injury, and environmental stresses.
### Epidermis includes the Greek prefix epi-, meaning “outer” (see
### EPI
### );
### thus, the epidermis overlies the dermis, or inner layer of skin. The
### epidermis itself consists of four or five layers; the outermost layer is
### made of dead cells, which are being shed continuously. The
### epidermis acts as a physical barrier—a protective wrap over the
### body's surface, which, by preventing water loss, allows vertebrates
### to live on land.

### taxidermist
### One who prepares, stuffs, and
### mounts the skins of dead animals.
### • The taxidermist suggested that the bobcat be displayed in the act
### of leaping fiercely toward the viewer.
### Taxidermists are called on not only by sportsmen and collectors but
### by museums, movie studios, and advertisers. Taxidermists first
### remove the skin (with its fur, hair, or feathers), then create a plaster
### cast of the carcass with which to produce a “mannequin,” on which
### they replace the skin. Producing trophies of lifelike quality that often
### recreate an exciting moment requires physical skill, attention to
### detail, and sometimes artistic talent.

### dermatitis
### Inflammation of the skin.
### • The only dermatitis she had ever suffered had been the result of
### playing in poison ivy when she was little.
### Dermatitis usually appears as a rash, and may cause itching, blisters,
### swelling, and often scabbing and scaling. It often marks an allergic
### reaction of some kind. Contact dermatitis is caused by something
### (often a chemical) touching the skin. Atopic dermatitis usually affects
### the insides of the elbows, the backs of the knees, and the face;
### generally resulting from an inherited sensitivity, it's often triggered
### by inhaling something. Eczema, psoriasis, and dandruff are all forms
### of dermatitis. Even in the worst cases, dermatitis isn't infectious and
### doesn't produce serious health consequences.

### ENDO
### comes from the Greek endon, meaning “within.” In English it
### appears almost always in scientific terms, especially in biology. A
### nonscientific endo- word is endogamy, meaning marriage within a
### specific group as required by custom or law—one of the many
### customs that can be seen everywhere from the most remote tribes
### to the highest society in wealthy countries.

### endocrine
### (1) A hormone. (2) Any of several glands
### (such as the thyroid) that pour their secretions directly into the
### blood or lymph.
### • Since the endocrines are so vital to human life, affecting such
### things as cell growth and blood sugar, the chemicals known as
### endocrine disrupters can be destructive and even deadly.
### The body's glands remove specific substances from the blood and
### alter them for rerelease into the blood or removal. Glands such as
### those that produce saliva and sweat secrete their products through
### tiny ducts or tubes on or near the body's surface. The glands
### without ducts, called the endocrine glands, instead secrete their
### products into the bloodstream; the endo- root indicates that the
### secretions are internal rather than on the surface. The endocrine
### system includes such glands as the pituitary (which controls growth,
### regulates the other endocrines, and performs many other tasks), the
### thyroid (another growth gland that also influences metabolism), the
### adrenals (which secrete adrenaline and steroids), the hypothalamus
### (which influences sleep and weight regulation), and the ovaries
### (which produce eggs). Endocrine problems are treated by
### endocrinologists.

### endodontic
### Relating to a branch of dentistry that
### deals with the pulp of the teeth.
### • Her dentist told her the problem was endodontic and that she
### should see a specialist soon to prevent loss of the tooth.
### Endodontists, as you might expect from the endo- root, deal with
### the interior of the tooth. The tooth's enamel, on the outside, covers
### a thick layer called the dentin; this in turn surrounds the innermost
### part, called the pulp, a mass of soft tissue through which nerves and
### blood vessels run. When a tooth has been badly damaged by decay
### or cracking, producing a risk of dangerous infection of the pulp, a
### “root canal” procedure is performed by an endodontist. Try to avoid
### ever getting to know an endodontist; brush your teeth twice daily,
### floss before bedtime, and never let a cavity go unfilled for long.

### endogenous
### Developing or originating within a cell,
### organ, body, or system.
### • Vitamin D can be obtained from food and supplements, but it's
### also an endogenous vitamin, produced by the body when the skin is
### exposed to sunlight.
### When biologists need to make a distinction between things that are
### produced within a cell or organ and things that affect it from the
### outside, they use the terms endogenous and exogenous. It used to
### be thought, for instance, that mutations in cells always resulted from
### exogenous causes, until it was discovered that substances in the
### body,
### including
### those
### called
### oxidants,
### could
### cause
### them
### endogenously as well. “Circadian rhythms”—the regular cycles,
### roughly 24 hours in length, that plants, animals, and humans rely on
### to regulate their days—are endogenously generated and don't
### actually depend on the sun for their timing.

### endorphin
### Any of a group of proteins in the brain that
### are able to relieve pain.
### • On the final stretch of her daily five-mile run, she could usually
### count on the endorphins kicking in, giving her that beautiful
### “runner's high.”
### The word endorphin was coined, back when the substances were
### discovered in the 1970s, by joining pieces of endogenous and
### morphine, morphine being a narcotic that closely resembles the
### endorphins and relieves pain in a similar way. Studies suggest that
### the pain-relieving practice called acupuncture (see
### acupuncture
### )
### works by releasing endorphins. Endorphins also seem to play an
### important role in pregnancy. Though much remains to be learned
### about the endorphins, the general public seems ready to give them
### credit for any all-natural high.
