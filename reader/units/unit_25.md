### VERB
### comes from the Latin verbum, meaning “word.” A verb—or
### action word—appears in some form in every complete sentence. To
### express something verbally—or to verbalize something—is to say it
### or write it.

### verbose
### Using more words than are needed; wordy.
### • The writing style in government publications has often been both
### dry and verbose—a deadly combination.
### Americans brought up on fast-paced TV shows and action films have
### lost any patience they once had for verbosity. So most American
### writing is brisk, and American speakers usually don't waste many
### words. But many of us love our own voices and opinions and don't
### realize we're being verbose until our listeners start stifling their
### yawns. And students still try to fill up the pages of their term papers
### with unneeded verbosity.

### proverb
### A brief, often-repeated statement that
### expresses a general truth or common observation.
### • “Waste not, want not” used to be a favorite proverb in many
### households.
### Proverbs probably appeared with the dawn of language. Sayings
### such as “A stitch in time saves nine,” or “Pride goeth before a fall,” or
### “Least said, soonest mended,” or “To everything there is a season”
### are easily memorized nuggets of wisdom. But the convenient thing
### about proverbs is that there's often one for every point of view. For
### every “Look before you leap” there's a “He who hesitates is lost.” “A
### fool and his money are soon parted” can be countered with “To
### make money you have to spend money.” A cynic once observed,
### “Proverbs are invaluable treasures to dunces with good memories.”

### verbatim
### In the exact words; word for word.
### • It turned out that the writer had lifted long passages verbatim
### from an earlier, forgotten biography of the statesman.
### Verbatim comes directly from Latin into English with the same
### spelling and meaning. Memorizing famous speeches, poems, or
### literary passages is a good way to both train the memory and absorb
### the classic texts of our literature and culture. At one time the ability
### to recite verbatim the Gettysburg Address, the beginning of the
### Declaration of Independence, and great speeches from Shakespeare
### was the mark of a well-educated person. But when that language
### was quoted by a writer, he or she was always careful to put
### quotation marks around it and tell readers who the true author was.

### verbiage
### An excess of words, often with little content;
### wordiness.
### • The agency's report was full of unnecessary verbiage, which
### someone should have edited out before the report was published.
### Government reports are notorious for their unfortunate tendency
### toward empty verbiage, through part of the reason is simply that
### officials are anxious to be following all the rules. Legal documents
### are also generally full of verbiage, partly because lawyers want to be
### sure that every last possibility has been covered and no loopholes
### have been left. But writing that contains unneeded verbiage is often
### trying to disguise its lack of real substance or clarity of thought. And
### every writer, including government workers and lawyers, should be
### constantly on the lookout for opportunities to hit the Delete key.

### SIMIL/SIMUL
### come from the Latin adjective similis, meaning “like,
### resembling, similar,” and the verb simulare, “to make like.” Two
### similar things resemble each other. Two simultaneous activities
### proceed at the same time. And a facsimile, such as you might
### receive from your fax machine, looks exactly the same as the
### original.

### simile
### A figure of speech, introduced by as or like, that
### makes a point of comparison between two things different in all
### other respects.
### • He particularly liked the simile he'd thought of for the last line of
### the song's chorus, “It felt like a bullet in his heart.”
### Fiction, poetry, and philosophy have been full of similes for
### centuries. In fact, the oldest literature known to us uses similes,
### along with their close relatives known as metaphors (see
### metaphorical
### ). This suggests that similes are an essential part of
### imaginative writing in all times and all cultures. When Tennyson,
### describing an eagle, writes “And like a thunderbolt he falls,” he's
### using a simile, since the line makes a specific comparison. “The road
### was a ribbon of moonlight” could be called a metaphor, though “The
### road was like a ribbon of moonlight” would be a simile.

### assimilate
### (1) To take in and thoroughly understand.
### (2) To cause to become part of a different society or culture.
### • One of the traditional strengths of American society has been its
### ability to assimilate one group of immigrants after another.
### Assimilate comes from the Latin verb assimulare, “to make similar,”
### and it originally applied to the process by which food is taken into
### the body and absorbed into the system. In a similar way, a fact can
### be taken into the mind, thoroughly digested, and absorbed into
### one's store of knowledge. A newcomer to a job or a subject must
### assimilate an often confusing mass of information; only after it's
### been thoroughly absorbed can the person make intelligent use of it.
### An immigrant family assimilates into its new culture by gradually
### adopting a new language and the habits of their new neighbors—a
### process that's always easier for the children than for the parents.

### simulacrum
### A copy, especially a superficial
### likeness or imitation.
### • As a boy he had filled his bedroom with model fighter jets, and
### these simulacra had kept his flying fantasies active for years.
### In its original meaning, a simulacrum is simply a representation of
### something else; so an original oil painting, marble statue, or plastic
### figurine could all be simulacra (notice the plural form) in the old
### sense. But today the word usually means a copy that's meant to
### substitute for the real thing—and usually a cheap and inferior copy, a
### pale imitation of the original. So in old Persia a beautifully laid out
### garden was a simulacrum of paradise. Some countries' governments
### are mere simulacra of democracy, since the people in power always
### steal the elections by miscounting the votes. And a bad actor might
### do a simulacrum of grief on the stage that doesn't convince anyone.

### simulate
### (1) To take on the appearance or effect of
### something, often in order to deceive. (2) To make a realistic
### imitation of something, such as a physical environment.
### • The armed services have made extensive use of video games to
### simulate the actual experience of warfare for their recruits.
### The zircon, that favorite of home shopping channels, simulates a
### diamond—more or less. A skilled furrier can dye lower-grade furs to
### simulate real mink. A skilled actress can simulate a range of
### emotions from absolute joy to crushing despair. And an apparatus
### that simulates the hazards of driving while intoxicated is likely to
### provide some very real benefits.

### Answers

### SCEND
### comes from the Latin verb scandere, “to climb.” The
### staircase we ascend to our bedroom at night we will descend the
### next morning, since what goes up must come down.

### transcend
### To rise above the limits of; overcome,
### surpass.
### • His defeat in the election had been terribly hard on him, and it
### took two years before he finally felt he had transcended the
### bitterness it had produced.
### Great leaders are expected to transcend the limitations of politics,
### especially during wartime and national crises. A great writer may
### transcend geographical boundaries to become internationally
### respected. And certain laws of human nature seem to transcend
### historical periods and hold true for all times and all places.

### condescend
### (1) To stoop to a level of lesser
### importance or dignity. (2) To behave as if superior.
### • Every so often my big brother would condescend to take me to a
### movie, but only when my parents made him.
### Back when society was more rigidly structured, condescend didn't
### sound so negative. People of higher rank, power, or social position
### had to overlook certain established rules of behavior if they wished
### to have social dealings with people of lower status, but such
### condescension was usually gracious and courteous. In today's more
### classless society, the term implies a manner that may be slightly
### offensive. A poor relation is unlikely to be grateful to a wealthy and
### condescending relative who passes on her secondhand clothes, and
### employees at an office party may not be thrilled when the boss's
### wife condescends to mingle with them. Often the word is used
### rather unseriously, as when a friend comments that a snooty sales
### clerk condescended to wait on her after ignoring her for several
### minutes.

### descendant
### (1) One that has come down from
### another or from a common stock. (2) One deriving directly from a
### forerunner or original.
### • Though none of the great man's descendants ever came close to
### achieving what he had, most of them enjoyed very respectable
### careers.
### Descendant is the opposite of ancestor. Your grandparents'
### descendants are those who are descended from them—your parents,
### your brothers and sisters, and any children that any of you may
### have. It's been claimed that every person on earth is a descendant
### of Muhammad, and of every historical person before him—Julius
### Caesar, the Buddha, etc.—who started a line of descent. (Some of us
### still find this hard to believe.) And not all descendants are human;
### every modern thesaurus, for example, could be called the
### descendant of the one devised by Peter Mark Roget in 1852.

### ascendancy
### Governing or controlling interest;
### domination.
### • China's growing ascendancy over Tibet was capped by the invasion
### of 1950.
### In the course of a year, the sun appears to pass through the twelve
### constellations of the zodiac in sequence, and all the planets also lie
### close to the solar path. The constellation and planet that are just
### rising, or ascendant, above the eastern horizon in the sun's path at
### the moment of a child's birth are said by astrologers to exercise a
### lifelong controlling influence over the child. This is the idea that lies
### at the heart of ascendancy, though the word today no longer hints
### at supernatural powers.

### ONYM
### comes from the Greek onyma, meaning “name, word.” An
### anonymous donor or writer is one who isn't named. A synonym is a
### word with the same meaning as another word (see
### SYN
### ). And
### homonyms (see
### HOM/HOMO
### ) are words that look and sound alike
### but aren't actually related, such as well (“healthy”) and well (“a deep
### hole with water in it”).

### antonym
### A word that means the opposite of some
### other word.
### • There's no point in telling a three-year-old that cat isn't an
### antonym of dog, and sun isn't an antonym of moon.
### Antonym includes the Greek prefix ant-, meaning “opposite” (see
### ANT/ANTI
### ). Antonyms are often thought of in pairs: hot/cold,
### up/down, wet/dry, buy/sell, failure/success. But a word may have
### more than one antonym (old/young, old/new), especially when one
### of the words has synonyms (small/large, small/big, little/big), and a
### word
### may
### have
### many
### approximate
### antonyms
### (adore/hate,
### adore/detest, adore/loathe). But although lots of words have
### synonyms, not so many have antonyms. What would be the
### antonym of pink? weather? semipro? thirty? firefighter? wax? about?
### consider?

### eponymous
### Of, relating to, or being the person for
### whom something is named.
### • Adjectives such as Elizabethan, Victorian, and Edwardian show
### how the names of certain British monarchs have become eponymous
### for particular time periods and styles.
### Things as different as a bird, a river, and a drug may be named to
### honor someone. The Canadian city of Vancouver was named after
### the explorer George Vancouver; the diesel engine was named for its
### inventor, Rudolph Diesel; Alzheimer's disease was named after the
### physician Alois Alzheimer; and so on. Common eponymous terms
### include Ohm's law, Parkinson's Law, and the Peter Principle. And if
### the Beatles' famous “white album” actually has a name, it's usually
### called “The Beatles,” which means that it's eponymous as well. Don't
### be surprised if eponymous turns out to be a hard word to use; lots
### of other people have discovered the same thing.

### patronymic
### Part of a personal name based on the
### name of one's father or one of his ancestors.
### • Reading Tolstoy's vast novel, it can be helpful to know that Helene
### Vasilievna's second name is a patronymic, and thus that her father is
### named Vasili.
### A patronymic, or patronym (see also
### PATER/PATR
### ), is generally
### formed by adding a prefix or suffix to a name. Thus, a few centuries
### ago, the male patronymic of Patrick was Fitzpatrick (“Patrick's son”),
### that of Peter was Peterson or Petersen, that of Donald was
### MacDonald or McDonald, and that of Hernando was Hernández.
### Today, of course, each of these is an ordinary family name, or
### surname. In Russia, both a patronymic and a surname are still used;
### in the name Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, for example, Ilyich is a
### patronymic meaning “son of Ilya.”

### pseudonym
### A name that someone (such as a writer)
### uses instead of his or her real name.
### • Hundreds of Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and Bobbsey Twins novels
### were churned out under such pseudonyms as Franklin W. Dixon,
### Carolyn Keene, and Laura Lee Hope.
### The Greek pseudo- is used in English to mean “false,” or sometimes
### “resembling.” A pseudonym is thus a false name, or alias. A writer's
### pseudonym is called a pen name, as in the case of Howard O'Brien
### (who usually writes as “Anne Rice” but sometimes under other
### names), and an actor's pseudonym is called a stage name, as in the
### case of Marion Morrison (“John Wayne”). A cadre name may be used
### for the sake of secrecy by a revolutionary plotter such as Vladimir
### Ulyanov (“Lenin”) or Iosif Dzhugashvili (“Stalin”). And in many
### religious orders, members adopt devotional names, as Agnes
### Bojaxhiu did in 1931 (“Teresa,” later known as “Mother Teresa”).

### SCRIB/SCRIP
### comes from the Latin verb scribere, “to write.”
### Scribble is an old word meaning to write or draw carelessly. A
### written work that hasn't been published is a manuscript. And to
### describe is to picture something in words.

### conscription
### Enforced enlistment of persons,
### especially for military service; draft.
### • The first comprehensive system for nationwide conscription was
### instituted by France for the Napoleonic wars that followed the
### French Revolution.
### With its scrip- root, conscription means basically writing someone's
### name on a list—a list that, unfortunately, a lot of people usually don't
### want to be on. Conscription has existed at least since ancient Egypt's
### Old Kingdom (27th century B.C.), though universal conscription has
### been rare throughout history. Forms of conscription were used by
### Prussia, Switzerland, Russia, and other European powers in the 17th
### and 18th centuries. In the U.S., conscription was first applied during
### the Civil War, by both the North and the South. In the North there
### were pockets of resistance, and the draft led to riots in several cities.
### The U.S. abandoned conscription at the end of the war and didn't
### revive it until World War I.

### circumscribe
### (1) To clearly limit the range or
### activity of something. (2) To draw a line around or to surround with
### a boundary.
### • Some children do best when their freedom is clearly circumscribed
### and their activities are supervised.
### The prefix circum-, “around,” is the key to circumscribe's basic
### meaning. Thus, we could say that a boxing ring is circumscribed by
### ropes, just as the area for an archaeological dig may be. A
### governor's power is always circumscribed by a state's constitution.
### And a physician's assistant has a circumscribed role that doesn't
### include writing prescriptions.

### inscription
### (1) Something permanently written,
### engraved, or printed, particularly on a building, coin, medal, or piece
### of currency. (2) The dedication of a book or work of art.
### • All U.S. coins bear the Latin inscription “E pluribus unum”—“From
### many, one.”
### With its prefix in-, meaning “in” or “on,” it's not surprising that an
### inscription is either written on or engraved into a surface.
### Inscriptions in the ancient world were always chiseled into stone, as
### inscriptions still may be today. The principal monument of the
### Vietnam memorial in Washington, D.C., for instance, is a black wall
### on which are inscribed the names of all the Americans who died
### during the war—each name in full, row upon seemingly endless row.
### But an inscription may also be a dedication, such as the words “For
### my wife” all by themselves on a page near the beginning of a book.

### proscribe
### To forbid as harmful or unlawful; prohibit.
### • Despite thousands of laws proscribing littering, many of America's
### streets and public spaces continue to be dumping grounds.
### The Latin prefix pro- sometimes meant “before,” in the sense of “in
### front of” the people. So in ancient Rome proscribere meant to make
### public in writing the name of a person who was about to be
### executed, and whose property would be seized by the state. But the
### meaning of the English word soon shifted to mean simply “prohibit”
### instead. Proscribe today is actually often the opposite of the very
### similar prescribe, which means basically “require.”

### FALL
### comes from the Latin verb fallere, “to deceive.” It's actually at
### the root of the word false, which we rarely use today to mean
### “deceptive,” though that meaning does show up in older phrases:
### “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,” for
### instance, or “A false-hearted lover will send you to your grave.”
### Fallere is even at the root of fail and fault, though you might not
### guess it to look at them.

### fallacy
### A wrong belief; a false or mistaken idea.
### • In her new article she exposes yet another fallacy at the heart of
### these economic arguments.
### Philosophers are constantly using the word fallacy. For them, a
### fallacy is reasoning that comes to a conclusion without the evidence
### to support it. This may have to do with pure logic, with the
### assumptions that the argument is based on, or with the way words
### are used, especially if they don't keep exactly the same meaning
### throughout the argument. There are many classic fallacies that occur
### again and again through the centuries and everywhere in the world.
### You may have heard of such fallacies as the “ad hominem” fallacy,
### the “question-begging” fallacy, the “straw man” fallacy, the “slippery
### slope” fallacy, the “gambler's” fallacy, or the “red herring” fallacy.
### Look them up and see if you've ever been guilty of any of them.

### fallacious
### Containing a mistake; not true or accurate.
### • Any policy that's based on a lot of fallacious assumptions is going
### to be a bad one.
### Fallacious is a formal and intellectual word. We rarely use it in casual
### speech; when we do, we risk sounding a bit full of ourselves and all-
### knowing. But it's used widely in writing, especially when one writer
### is arguing with another. And it's used to describe both errors in fact
### and errors in reasoning, including fallacies of the kind described in
### the previous entry.

### fallibility
### Capability of making mistakes or being
### wrong.
### • Doctors are concerned about the fallibility of these tests, which
### seem unable to detect the virus about 20% of the time.
### You'll find this word showing up in discussions of eyewitness
### testimony at crime scenes, of lie detectors, and of critical airplane
### parts. Some of us are most familiar with the fallibility of memory,
### especially when we remember something clearly that turns out never
### to have happened. Being fallible is part of being human, and
### sometimes the biggest errors are made by those who are thought of
### as the most brilliant of all.

### infallible
### (1) Not capable of being wrong or making
### mistakes. (2) Certain to work properly or succeed.
### • Two college friends of mine claimed to have an infallible system for
### beating the odds at roulette in Las Vegas.
### Watch out when you hear about infallible predictions, an infallible
### plan, an infallible cure, or even infallible lip gloss. Infallible isn't a
### claim that scientists, engineers, and doctors like to make, so you're
### probably getting better information when the word not comes first.
### You may have heard the phrase “papal infallibility,” which refers to
### the official position of the Roman Catholic church, adopted in the
### 19th century, that certain solemn statements made by a Pope about
### faith or morals were not to be questioned. Popes since then have
### been careful not to make many of these statements.

### Answers

### SOLU
### comes from the Latin verb solvere, “to loosen, free, release,”
### and the root therefore may take the form solv- as well. So to solve a
### problem means to find its solution, as if you were freeing up a
### logjam. And a solvent is a chemical that dissolves or “loosens up” oil
### or paint.

### soluble
### (1) Able to be dissolved in a liquid, especially
### water. (2) Able to be solved or explained.
### • To an optimistic young principal, the problems of a school like this
### one might seem challenging but soluble.
### Soluble looks like a word that should be confined to chemistry labs,
### though it's often used by nonchemists as well to describe substances
### that can be dissolved in liquids. On the other hand, the sense of
### soluble meaning “solvable” is also quite common. In this sense,
### soluble, like its opposite, insoluble, is usually paired with problem. If
### only all life's problems were soluble by stirring them in a container
### filled with water.

### absolution
### The act of forgiving someone for their
### sins.
### • Every week she would kneel to confess her little sins and receive
### absolution from the priest.
### Since the Latin absolutus meant “set free,” it's easy to see how
### absolution came to mean “set free from sin.” (And also easy to see
### why absolute means basically “pure”—that is, originally, “free of
### sin.”) The verb for absolution is absolve. Just as a priest absolves
### believers of their sins, you may absolve your brother of blame for a
### household disaster, or you yourself may in time be absolved for that
### scrape on the car backing out of a parking space.

### dissolution
### The act or process of breaking down
### or apart into basic components, as through disruption or decay.
### • The dissolution of the U.S.S.R. was probably the most momentous
### event of the last quarter of the 20th century.
### Dissolution is the noun form of dissolve, but it's a much less
### common word. Still, we refer to the fact that the dissolution of
### American marriages became far more common in the later 20th
### century. Or that when India won its independence in 1948, the
### dissolution of the once-global British empire was all but complete. Or
### that factors such as crime and drugs might be contributing to the
### dissolution of contemporary society's moral fabric. A dissolute person
### is someone in whom all restraint has dissolved, and who now
### indulges in behavior that shocks decent people.

### resolute
### Marked by firm determination.
### • After ten years of indecision, the Senate finally seems resolute
### about reaching an agreement.
### Resolute comes from the same Latin verb as resolved, and the two
### words are often synonyms. So how did it get this meaning from the
### Latin? Essentially, when you resolve a question or problem, you
### come to a conclusion, and once you've reached a conclusion you can
### proceed to act. So in your New Year's resolutions, you resolve—or
### make up your mind—to do something. Unfortunately, New Year's
### resolutions aren't a good illustration of the meaning of resolute,
### since only about one in ten actually seems to succeed.

### HYDR
### flows from the Greek word for “water.” The “water” root can
### be found in the lovely flower called the hydrangea: its seed capsules
### resemble ancient Greek water vessels.

### hydraulic
### (1) Relating to water; operated, moved, or
### brought about by means of water. (2) Operated by the resistance or
### pressure of liquid forced through a small opening or tube.
### • Without any hydraulic engineers, the country is unlikely to build
### many dams or reservoirs on its own.
### By means of a hydraulic lift, the driver can lift the bed of a dump
### truck with the touch of a button. He might also repair the hydraulic
### steering, the hydraulic brake, or the hydraulic clutch—all of which,
### like the lift that holds everything up, take advantage of the way
### liquids act under pressure. Somewhat like a pulley or a lever, a
### hydraulic system magnifies the effect of moderate pressure exerted
### over a longer distance into powerful energy for a shorter distance.

### dehydrate
### (1) To remove water from. (2) To deprive
### of energy and zest.
### • The boy appeared at dusk staggering out of the desert,
### dangerously sunburned and dehydrated.
### Dehydrating food is a good way to preserve it; raisins, which are
### dehydrated grapes, are a good example. Dehydration through
### industrial processes makes it possible to keep food even longer and
### store it in a smaller space. Freeze-drying produces food that only
### needs rehydration—that is, the addition of water—to restore its
### original consistency. Runners, cyclists, and hikers fearful of
### dehydration seem to be constantly hydrating themselves nowadays,
### sometimes even using a shoulder pack with a tube going straight
### into the mouth. Dehydrate can also be used for making something
### “dry” or “lifeless”; thus, a dull teacher can dehydrate American
### history, and an unimaginative staging can dehydrate a great
### Shakespeare play.

### hydroelectric
### Having to do with the production
### of electricity by waterpower.
### • A massive African hydroelectric project is creating the world's
### largest manmade lake, and is said to hold the key to the future for
### the country.
### The prime component of most hydroelectric systems is a dam. A
### high dam funnels water downward at high pressure to spin turbines,
### which in turn drive generators to produce high-voltage electricity.
### Mountainous countries with rushing rivers can produce the most
### hydroelectricity. Though hydroelectricity comes from a clean and
### completely renewable energy source, dams disrupt natural systems
### in a way that disturbs environmentalists.

### hydroponics
### The growing of plants in nutrient
### solutions, with or without supporting substances such as sand or
### gravel.
### • He had never thought hydroponics produced vegetables as tasty as
### those grown in soil, and the tomatoes seemed particularly
### disappointing.
### Hydroponics, also known as aquaculture or tank farming, began as a
### way of studying scientifically the mechanisms of plant nutrition.
### Hydroponically grown plants may have no solid material under them
### at all; instead, their roots often simply hang in water with a rich mix
### of nutrients dissolved in it. The principal advantage to hydroponics is
### the savings from reduced labor costs, since it's generally carried on
### in enclosed areas and the irrigation and fertilizing are done
### mechanically. Peppers, cucumbers, and various other vegetables are
### produced hydroponically in huge quantities.

## Greek and Latin Borrowings
### aegis
### (1) Something that protects or defends; shield. (2)
### Sponsorship or guidance by an individual or organization.
### • The conference was held under the aegis of the World Affairs
### Council, which provided almost all of the funding.
### The original aegis was a goatskin shield or breastplate, symbolizing
### majesty, that was worn by Zeus and his daughter Athena in Greek
### mythology. Athena's aegis bore the severed head of the monstrous
### Medusa. Aegis came to be used for any kind of invulnerable shield.
### But today we almost always use the word in the phrase “under the
### aegis of . . . ,” which means “under the authority, sponsorship, or
### control of.”

### charisma
### (1) An extraordinary gift for leadership that
### attracts popular support and enthusiasm. (2) A special ability to
### attract or charm; magnetism.
### • Many later leaders have envied the charisma of Napoleon
### Bonaparte, who many of his followers genuinely believed to be
### immortal.
### Charisma is Greek for “gift,” but its traditional meaning comes from
### Christian belief, where it originally referred to an extraordinary power
### —the gift of healing, the gift of tongues, or the gift of prophecy—
### bestowed on an individual by the Holy Spirit. The first nonreligious
### use of charisma didn't appear until the 20th century, when it was
### applied to that mysterious personal magnetism that a lucky few
### seem to possess, especially the magnetism with which a political
### leader can arouse great popular enthusiasm. When John F. Kennedy
### was elected president in 1960, its use by journalists popularized the
### term in the mass media. Since then, actors, rock stars, athletes,
### generals, and entrepreneurs have all been said to possess charisma.

### ego
### (1) A sense of confidence and satisfaction in oneself;
### self-esteem. (2) An exaggerated sense of self-importance.
### • His raging ego was what his fellow lawyers remembered about him
### —his tantrums, his vanity, his snobbery, and all the rest of it.
### Ego is the Latin word for “I.“ So if a person seems to begin every
### sentence with “I,” it's sometimes a sign of a big ego. It was the
### psychologist Sigmund Freud (well, actually his original translator)
### who put ego into the popular vocabulary, but what he meant by the
### word is complex, so only other psychologists really use it in the
### Freudian sense. The rest of us generally use ego simply to mean
### one's sense of self-worth, whether exaggerated or not. When used
### in the “exaggerated” sense, ego is almost the same thing as conceit.
### Meeting a superstar athlete without a trace of this kind of ego would
### be a most refreshing experience. But having a reasonable sense of
### your own worth is no sin. Life's little everyday victories are good—in
### fact, necessary—for a healthy ego.

### ethos
### The features, attitudes, moral code, or basic beliefs
### that define a person, a group, or an institution.
### • The company's ethos has always been an interesting blend of
### greed and generosity.
### Ethos means “custom” or “character” in Greek. As originally used by
### Aristotle, it referred to a man's character or personality, especially in
### its balance between passion and caution. Today ethos is used to
### refer to the practices or values that distinguish one person,
### organization, or society from others. So we often hear of the ethos
### of rugged individualism and self-sufficiency on the American frontier
### in the 19th century; and a critic might complain about, for example,
### the ethos of violence in the inner cities or the ethos of
### permissiveness in the suburbs.

### hubris
### Unreasonable or unjustified pride or self-
### confidence.
### • Two hours later, the team's boastful pregame hubris bumped into
### the embarrassing reality of defeat.
### To the Greeks, hubris referred to extreme pride, especially pride and
### ambition so great that they offend the gods and lead to one's
### downfall. Hubris was a character flaw often seen in the heroes of
### classical Greek tragedy, including Oedipus and Achilles. The familiar
### old saying “Pride goeth before a fall” is basically talking about
### hubris.

### id
### The part of a person's unconscious mind that relates to basic
### needs and desires.
### • His own id often scared him, especially when a sudden violent
### impulse would well up out of nowhere.
### In Latin, id means simply “it.” Sigmund Freud (and his translator)
### brought the word into the modern vocabulary as the name of what
### Freud believed to be one of the three basic elements of the human
### personality, the other two being the ego (see
### ego
### ) and the
### superego. According to Freud, the id is the first of these to develop,
### and is the home of the body's basic instincts, particularly those
### involving sex and aggression. Since the id lacks logic, reason, or
### even organization, it can contain conflicting impulses. Primitive in
### nature, it wants to be satisfied immediately. Although its workings
### are completely unconscious, Freud believed that its contents could
### be revealed in works of art, in slips of the tongue (“Freudian slips”),
### and in one's dreams.

### libido
### (1) Sexual drive. (2) In psychoanalytic theory,
### energy that is derived from primitive biological urges and is usually
### goal-oriented.
### • She would sit at home trying not to think about where his
### unmanageable libido had led him this time.
### The Latin word libido, meaning “desire, lust,” was borrowed by
### Sigmund Freud as the name for a concept in his own theories. At
### first he defined libido to mean the instinctual energy associated with
### the sex drive. Later he broadened the word's meaning and began
### using it to mean the mental energy behind purposeful human
### activity of any kind; in other words, the libido (for which Freud also
### used the term eros, a Greek word meaning “sexual love”) came to
### be regarded as the life instinct, which included sex along with all the
### other impulses we rely on to keep us alive. But those of us who
### aren't psychologists use the word simply as a synonym for “sex
### drive.”

### trauma
### (1) A serious injury to the body. (2) An abnormal
### psychological state caused by mental or emotional stress or physical
### injury.
### • Fifteen years later, their adopted Cambodian daughter was still
### having nightmares in which she relived the trauma of those terrible
### years.
### Trauma is the Greek word for “wound.” Although the Greeks used
### the term only for physical injuries, nowadays trauma is just as likely
### to refer to emotional wounds. We now know that a traumatic event
### can leave psychological symptoms long after any physical injuries
### have healed. The psychological reaction to emotional trauma now
### has an established name: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. It
### usually occurs after an extremely stressful event, such as wartime
### combat, a natural disaster, or sexual or physical abuse; its symptoms
### include depression, anxiety, flashbacks, and recurring nightmares.
