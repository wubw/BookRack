### NOM
### comes from the Latin word for “name.” A nominee is a person
### “named”—or nominated—to run for or serve in office. A binomial
### (“two names”) is the scientific name for a species: Felis catus for the
### house cat, for example. A polynomial, with “many names,” is an
### algebra expression involving several terms: 2x
2
### + 9y – z
3
### , for
### instance.

### nominal
### (1) Existing in name or form only and not in
### reality. (2) So small as to be unimportant; insignificant.
### • The actor himself was the nominal author, but 90 percent of the
### prose was the work of his ghostwriter.
### Something nominal exists only in name. So the nominal ruler in a
### constitutional monarchy is the king or queen, but the real power is in
### the hands of the elected prime minister. In the United Kingdom, the
### British monarch is also the nominal head of the Church of England;
### and those baptized in the Church who aren't really churchgoers
### might be called nominal Christians. A fee can be called nominal
### when it's small in comparison to the value of what it buys. So, for
### example, you might sell a friend a good piece of furniture for a
### nominal amount. And the charge for a doctor's visit might be a
### nominal $20, since most of the cost is covered by an insurance plan.

### nomenclature
### (1) A name or designation, or
### the act of naming. (2) A system of terms or symbols used in biology,
### where New Latin names are given to kinds and groups of animals
### and plants.
### • Naming newly discovered plants or animals requires close study of
### the system of nomenclature.
### Various specialized fields have their own particular nomenclatures, or
### sets of terms. In particle physics, for instance, the elementary
### particles known as quarks, which are believed to come in pairs, have
### acquired such names as “up” and “down,” “strange” and “charm,”
### and “truth” and “beauty”—which is all most of us know about quarks
### and all we need to know. But nomenclature is used most often for
### the system of biological classification created by Linnaeus. In
### Linnaeus's system, each species has its own two-word name, the
### first word being the name of its genus. Thus, the genus Equus
### includes the horse (Equus caballus) and the mountain zebra (Equus
### zebra). But since broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage actually all
### belong to the same species (Brassica oleracea), they each need a
### third name to distinguish themselves.

### ignominious
### (1) Marked with shame or disgrace;
### dishonorable. (2) Humiliating or degrading.
### • If Attila the Hun was truly murdered by his bride on their wedding
### night, it was a most ignominious death for a warrior.
### The Latin nomen could mean both “name” and “good reputation,”
### and even today we can say that someone who has been disgraced
### has “lost his good name.” With its negative prefix ig-, ignominious
### indicates the “namelessness” that goes with shame or dishonor. A
### person who suffers an ignominious fate may die nameless and
### forgotten. In the former Soviet Union, party leaders who fell out of
### favor, even if they avoided being imprisoned or executed, became
### nonpersons. Their names were removed from official records and
### history books and they were treated as if they had never existed.

### misnomer
### A wrong name, or the use of a wrong
### name.
### • Calling the native peoples of the western hemisphere “Indians”
### was one of the great misnomers in recorded history.
### Historians have long noted that the Holy Roman Empire in its later
### years was neither holy, Roman, nor an empire. The Battle of Bunker
### Hill was actually fought on nearby Breed's Hill. And the famous
### Woodstock Festival was actually held in the town of Bethel. But
### misnomers aren't limited to history. The Pennsylvania Dutch are
### actually of German ancestry. Koala bears aren't bears—they're
### marsupials. And in the world of food, the Rocky Mountain oyster, as
### diners have sometimes discovered too late, aren't really oysters.

### PATER/PATR
### comes from both the Greek and the Latin word for
### “father.” So a patron, for example, is someone who assumes a
### fatherly role toward an institution or project or individual, giving
### moral and financial support.

### patrician
### A person of high birth or of good breeding
### and cultivation; an aristocrat.
### • They passed themselves off as patricians, and no one looked too
### closely at where their money came from.
### A patrician was originally a descendant of one of the original citizen
### families of ancient Rome. Until about 350 B.C., only patricians could
### hold the office of senator, consul, or pontifex (priest). Later, the
### word was applied to members of the nobility created by the Roman
### emperor Constantine. As time went by, other nobles, such as those
### in medieval Italian republics and in German city-states, also came to
### be known as patricians. Today someone's appearance, manners, or
### tastes can be described as patrician, whether the person is actually
### of high birth or not. The actress Grace Kelly, an immigrant's
### daughter, was admired for her patrician beauty even before she
### became Princess Grace of Monaco, with classic features worthy of
### ancient Rome's finest sculptors.

### patriarchy
### (1) A family, group, or government
### controlled by a man or a group of men. (2) A social system in which
### family members are related to each other through their fathers.
### • She spent the 1980s raging against the patriarchy, which she
### claimed had destroyed the lives of millions of women.
### With its root -arch, meaning “ruler, leader,” a patriarch is a man who
### dominates something, even if it's just a family. In Christianity, the
### term is used for a few leading figures who appear early in the Old
### Testament, including Methuselah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; in the
### Eastern Orthodox church, a patriarch is usually the equivalent of a
### bishop. Outside of the field of anthropology, patriarchy didn't start to
### be used much until the 1970s, when the women's movement gained
### a huge following. Many feminists have claimed that all Western
### societies are patriarchal—that is, that they systematically enable
### men to dominate women. But there's plenty of disagreement about
### how this is done, and the word isn't discussed as often as it used to
### be.

### expatriate
### A person who has moved to a foreign
### land.
### • As he got to know his fellow expatriates in Morocco, he found
### himself wondering what had led each of them to leave America.
### Expatriate combines the prefix ex-, “out of” or “away from,” with the
### Latin patria, “fatherland.” A famous colony of expatriates was the
### group of writers and artists who gathered in Paris between the two
### world wars, including Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and
### Gertrude Stein. Unlike an exile or an emigrant, an expatriate's
### residence abroad is usually voluntary and extended but not
### permanent, and expatriates—often called expats—generally keep
### their original national identity and eventually end their self-imposed
### exiles by repatriating themselves.

### paternalistic
### Tending to supply the needs of or
### regulate the activities of those under one's control.
### • Some still accuse the university of being too paternalistic in
### regulating student living arrangements.
### A good father shows paternal concern about his children, just as a
### good mother often acts out of maternal feeling. But paternalistic has
### a negative sound nowadays, since paternalistic people or institutions
### seek—often with decent intentions—to control many aspects of the
### lives of those under their control. In the 19th century, mill owners
### actually often provided cheap housing for the mill's employees.
### Today companies frequently have strict rules regarding personal
### appearance, or against marriages within the company. Colleges and
### universities used to practice a kind of paternalism, especially in
### trying to keep men and women out of each other's dorms, but a
### changing society has mostly put an end to that.

### LEGA
### comes from the Latin legare, meaning “to appoint” or “to
### send as a deputy.” The same root actually shows up in such words
### as legal—but how the law connects with sending deputies can get
### awfully complicated and probably isn't worth going into.

### legate
### An official representative, such as an ambassador.
### • All the important European powers sent legates of some kind to
### the peace conference.
### Legate is a somewhat old-fashioned word, less used today than it
### was a century ago. More common is the synonym envoy. In the days
### before electronic communications, a legate often had particularly
### large responsibilities, since he couldn't check with his government to
### be sure he was doing the right thing. The Vatican still sends papal
### legates to represent the pope's point of view in negotiations.

### legacy
### (1) Something left to a person in a will. (2)
### Something handed down by an ancestor or predecessor or received
### from the past.
### • The Stradivarius family of violin makers left a priceless legacy of
### remarkable instruments.
### In its basic meaning, a legacy is a gift of money or other personal
### property that's granted by the terms of a will—often a substantial
### gift that needs to be properly managed. But the word is used much
### more broadly as well. So, for instance, much of Western civilization—
### law, philosophy, aesthetics— could be called the undying legacy of
### ancient Greece. And the rights and opportunities that women enjoy
### today are partly the legacy of the early suffragists and feminists.

### delegation
### A group of people chosen to represent
### the interests or opinions of others.
### • Each American colony sent a delegation to the Second Continental
### Congress, and in its second year all 56 delegates approved
### Jefferson's Declaration of Independence.
### The task of a delegation—each member of which can be called a
### delegate—is to represent a larger group, often at a conference.
### Thus, a delegation of nondoctors to a medical convention may want
### to make sure the rights and needs of patients aren't ignored, just as
### a delegation of laypeople may attend a religious conference to
### express the concerns of other laypeople.

### relegate
### (1) To remove or assign to a less important
### place. (2) To refer or hand over for decision or for carrying out.
### • First-year students were relegated to the back of the line so that
### all the upper classes could eat first.
### Originally relegate meant “to send into exile, banish.” So when you
### relegate an old sofa to the basement, you're sending it to home-
### decorating Siberia. When confronted with a matter that no one really
### wants to face, a chief executive may relegate it to a committee “for
### further study,” which may manage to ignore it for years. It may be
### annoying to read a newspaper article about a pet project and find
### that your own contributions have been relegated to a short sentence
### near the end.

### GREG
### comes from the Latin grex, “herd” or “flock.” Bees, starlings,
### cows—any creatures that like to live together in flocks or herds—are
### called gregarious, and the same word is used for people who enjoy
### companionship and are happiest when they're in the middle of a
### rowdy herd.

### aggregate
### A collection or sum of units or parts.
### • His lawyers realize that the aggregate of incriminating details is
### now pointing toward a conviction.
### An aggregate is often an example of something being greater than
### the sum of its parts. For instance, even if no individual element in a
### person's background would assure a criminal career, the aggregate
### of factors could make a life of crime seem unavoidable. Aggregate is
### often used in the phrase “in the aggregate,” as in “Her achievements
### were, in the aggregate, impressive enough to earn her a
### scholarship.” Aggregate is also an adjective, meaning “total”; so, for
### instance, economists often discuss aggregate demand for goods and
### services in the country's economy, just as you yourself might speak
### about your father's aggregate income from his three jobs.

### congregation
### (1) A gathering of people,
### especially for worship or religious instruction. (2) The membership of
### a church or temple.
### • That Sunday the congregation was especially large, and the
### minister delivered one of his best sermons.
### The verb congregate may be used for spontaneous gatherings. A
### crowd quickly congregates at the scene of an accident, for example,
### just as cows, sheep, or horses tend to congregate during a storm.
### And under military rule, citizens are often forbidden to congregate
### on street corners or anywhere else. But a congregation is generally a
### group that has gathered for a formal purpose, usually in church. The
### Congregational Church was originally the church of the Puritan
### settlers, in which each congregation governed its own church
### independent of any higher authority.

### egregious
### Standing out, especially in a bad way;
### flagrant.
### • Many of the term papers contained egregious grammatical errors.
### Since egregious begins with a short version of ex-, meaning “out of,”
### the word should mean literally “out of the herd.” So something
### egregious possesses some quality that sets it apart from others.
### Originally, that distinguishing quality was something good, but by
### the 16th century the word's meaning had taken a U-turn and the
### word was being applied to things that were outrageously bad. This
### has remained the most common sense. Thus, an egregious fool is
### one who manages to outdo run-of-the-mill fools, and egregious
### rudeness sets a new standard for unpleasant salesclerks.

### segregate
### (1) To separate from others or from the
### general mass; isolate. (2) To separate along racial lines.
### • Some schools are experimenting with gender segregation, claiming
### that both sexes learn better in classrooms from which the other sex
### is absent.
### The prefix se- means “apart,” so when you segregate something you
### set it apart from the herd. The word typically means separating
### something undesirable from the healthy majority. During the apple
### harvest, damaged fruit is segregated from the main crop and used
### for cider. In prisons, hardened criminals are segregated from
### youthful offenders. Lepers used to be segregated from the general
### population because they were thought to be highly infectious. The
### opposite of segregate is often integrate, and the two words were in
### the news almost daily for decades as African-Americans struggled to
### be admitted into all-white schools and neighborhoods.

### Answers

### FLU
### comes from the Latin verb fluere, “to flow.” So a flume is a
### narrow gorge with a stream flowing through it. A fluent speaker is
### one from whom words flow easily. Influence originally referred to an
### invisible fluid that was believed to flow from the stars and to affect
### the actions of humans. A mysterious outbreak of disease in 15th-
### century Italy led Italians to blame it on the stars' influenza—and the
### name stuck.

### affluence
### An abundance of wealth.
### • The affluence of the city's northern suburbs is indicated by the
### huge houses there.
### Affluence comes from the Latin verb affluere, “to flow abundantly.”
### Thus, someone or something blessed with affluence has received an
### incoming flood of riches. Since the affluent residents of suburbs
### often work in the central city but pay taxes back home, the wealth of
### some metropolitan areas tends to flow in one direction—out.

### effluent
### Polluting waste material discharged into the
### environment.
### • The effluent from the mill had long ago turned this once-beautiful
### stream into a foul-smelling open-air sewer.
### Effluent comes from the Latin verb effluere, “to flow out.” In an older
### meaning, an effluent was a stream flowing out of a river or lake. But
### nowadays effluent almost always means wastes that pour into our
### water and air. Liquid factory waste, smoke, and raw sewage can all
### be called effluents. An effluent filter keeps treated waste flowing out
### of a septic tank from clogging up its drainage pipes.

### confluence
### (1) A coming or flowing together at one
### point. (2) A place of meeting, especially of two streams.
### • The confluence of several large economic forces led to the “perfect
### storm” that shook the world economy in 2008.
### The joining of rivers—as at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, where the
### Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers flow together spectacularly—was
### the original meaning of confluence, and in its later meanings we still
### hear a strong echo of the physical merging of waters. So today we
### can speak of a confluence of events, a confluence of interests, a
### confluence of cultures, and so on, from which something important
### often emerges.

### mellifluous
### Flowing like honey; sweetened as if
### with honey.
### • His rich, mellifluous voice is familiar to us from countless voice-
### overs for commercials, station breaks, and documentaries.
### With its root mel-, meaning “honey,” mellifluous means literally
### “flowing like honey.” The word usually applies to sound; it has often
### been used to describe voices such as Renee Fleming's or Barbra
### Streisand's, or pieces by composers such as Ravel and Debussy. The
### DJ on a radio station that plays soft music may have a voice so
### mellifluous that it almost puts the listener to sleep.

### PREHEND/PREHENS
### comes from the Latin verb prehendere, “to
### seize.” Most of the English words where it appears are closely related
### to the ones discussed below.

### prehensile
### Adapted for grasping, especially by
### wrapping around.
### • The squid has eight short “arms” but also two long prehensile
### tentacles that it uses for catching its prey.
### Howler monkeys are among the American monkeys with prehensile
### tails. Famous for their booming howls, howlers can wrap their tails
### around a nearby branch while using their prehensile feet and hands
### for picking lice from their fur or lobbing a coconut at an unwelcome
### tourist. Our own hands are prehensile, of course. Our feet are not;
### on the other hand, they're much better for running than the
### prehensile feet of a monkey or ape.

### apprehend
### (1) Arrest, seize. (2) Understand.
### • It was a few minutes before she managed to apprehend the
### meaning of what she had just seen.
### To apprehend is to seize, either physically or mentally. So to
### apprehend a thief is to nab him. But to apprehend a confusing news
### story, or to apprehend a difficult concept in physics, is to understand
### it—that is, to “grasp” it mentally. If you're apprehensive about
### something that's about to happen, it means you've grasped all the
### unpleasant possibilities and are waiting with anxiety or dread.

### comprehend
### (1) To grasp the meaning of;
### understand. (2) To take in or include.
### • In the days following the dropping of the atomic bomb on
### Hiroshima, the public slowly began to comprehend the fact that the
### nuclear age had arrived.
### To comprehend is to mentally grasp something's complete nature or
### meaning. Comprehend is thus often a bit stronger than understand:
### for example, you may understand the instructions in a handbook
### without completely comprehending their purpose. Comprehend's
### second meaning is much less common. Using that sense of the
### word, we could say that good manners comprehends (that is,
### includes) more than simple table etiquette, for example, or that true
### courage comprehends more than just physical showing off. And
### something comprehensive includes a great deal: so a comprehensive
### exam, for instance, includes all the material that was studied in the
### course.

### reprehensible
### Deserving stern criticism or
### blame.
### • Whether or not he ever broke the law, his treatment of his first
### wife was thoroughly reprehensible.
### From its prefix re-, meaning “back,” reprehend would mean literally
### “to hold back, restrain”; but even the Latin version of the verb had
### come to mean “to scold, blame”—in other words, to restrain bad
### behavior by expressing disapproval. Reprehensible is applied to both
### things and people—that is, both the sin and the sinner. So a senator
### might be scolded for reprehensible conduct, but might also be called
### a thoroughly reprehensible person. And most of us would call
### dogfighting morally reprehensible, and would use the same word to
### describe those who put the dogs up to it.

### TEMPER
### comes from the Latin verb temperare, “to moderate or
### keep within limits” or “to mix.” Most of the world's people live in the
### temperate zone—that is, the zone where the temperature is
### moderate, between the hot tropics and the icy Arctic and Antarctic
### Circles. It's less easy to see how we get temperature from this root;
### the word actually used to refer to the mixing of different basic
### elements in the body, and only slowly came to mean how hot or cold
### that body was.

### temper
### To dilute, qualify, or soften by adding something
### more agreeable; to moderate.
### • A wise parent tempers discipline with love.
### The temper root keeps its basic meaning—“to mix” or “to keep
### within limits”—in the English word temper. When you temper
### something, you mix it with some balancing quality or substance so
### as to avoid anything extreme. Thus, it's often said that a judge must
### temper justice with mercy. Young people only gradually learn to
### temper their natural enthusiasms with caution. And in dealing with
### others, we all try to temper our honesty with sensitivity.

### temperance
### (1) Moderation in satisfying appetites or
### passions. (2) The drinking of little or no alcohol.
### • Buddhism teaches humankind to follow “the middle way”—that is,
### temperance in all things.
### Since temperance means basically “moderation,” you might assume
### that, with respect to alcohol, temperance would mean moderate
### consumption, or “social drinking.” Instead, the word has usually
### meant the prohibition of all alcohol. To temperance leaders such as
### Carry Nation, the safest form of drinking was no alcohol at all.
### Believing she was upholding the law, Nation began her hatchet-
### swinging attacks on saloons, known as “hatchetations,” in the 1890s.
### National prohibition did eventually come—and go—but largely
### through the efforts of more temperate (that is, moderate) reformers.

### intemperate
### Not moderate or mild; excessive,
### extreme.
### • Lovers of fine wines and scotches are almost never intemperate
### drinkers.
### Since the prefix in- generally means “not,” intemperate is the
### opposite of temperate. Someone intemperate rejects moderation in
### favor of excess. A religious fanatic is likely to preach with
### intemperate zeal, and a mean theater critic may become
### intemperate in her criticism of a new play, filling her review with
### intemperate language. And both temperate and intemperate also
### often refer to weather; a region with an intemperate climate isn't
### where all of us would choose to build a house.

### distemper
### (1) A highly contagious viral disease,
### especially of dogs. (2) A highly contagious and usually fatal viral
### disease, especially of cats, marked by the destruction of white blood
### cells.
### • An epidemic of feline distemper had swept the country, and its cat
### population had plummeted.
### Back when doctors believed that our moods were affected by an
### imbalance of mysterious fluids in the body, or “humors,” distemper
### often meant moodiness, as when Shakespeare's Hamlet is asked
### “What is the source of your distemper?” Today the word is used only
### for true physical conditions. The distemper that affects dogs, often
### called canine distemper, also affects foxes, wolves, mink, raccoons,
### and ferrets. It can be treated with medication, but is generally fatal
### if not treated. Distemper in cats, known as feline distemper or
### panleukopenia, actually isn't related to canine distemper. If caught
### quickly, it too can be treated. And both types can be prevented by
### vaccination, so all responsible pet owners get their animals
### vaccinated.

### PURG
### comes from the Latin verb purgare, “to clean or cleanse.”
### Almost all the English words where it shows up are closely related to
### those discussed below.

### purge
### (1) To clear of guilt or sin. (2) To free of something
### unwanted or considered impure.
### • During the 1930s, Stalin purged the Soviet communist party of
### thousands of members who he suspected of disloyalty.
### In some cultures, a ritual bath or prayer is performed to purge guilt
### or evil spirits. The Minoans of ancient Crete may have used human
### sacrifice as a way of purging the entire community, which is fine for
### the community but rough on the victims. In many cultures, people
### periodically purge themselves physically—that is, clean out their
### digestive tracts—by taking strong laxatives; this used to be a popular
### springtime ritual, and herbal purgatives were readily available.

### expurgate
### To cleanse of something morally harmful
### or offensive; to remove objectionable parts from.
### • In those years, high-school English classes only used expurgated
### editions of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.
### Expurgation has a long and questionable history. Perhaps history's
### most famous expurgator, or censor, was the English editor Thomas
### Bowdler, who in 1818 published the Family Shakespeare, an
### expurgated edition of Shakespeare's plays that omitted or changed
### any passages that, in Bowdler's opinion, couldn't decently be read
### aloud in a family. As a result, the term bowdlerize is now a synonym
### of expurgate.

### purgative
### (1) Cleansing or purifying, especially from
### sin. (2) Causing a significant looseness of the bowels.
### • I'm afraid my ten-year-old discovered the purgative effect of too
### many apples after a lazy afternoon in the orchard.
### Purgative can be used as a noun as well as an adjective. For
### centuries, doctors prescribed purgatives—that is, laxatives—for all
### kinds of ailments, not knowing anything better to do. Physical
### cleansing has always reminded people of emotional and spiritual
### cleansing, as expressed in the saying “Cleanliness is next to
### godliness.” So we may say, for example, that confession has a
### purgative effect on the soul. Some psychologists used to claim that
### expressing your anger is purgative; but in fact it may generally be no
### better for your emotional life than taking a laxative, and can
### sometimes really foul things up.

### purgatory
### (1) According to Roman Catholic
### doctrine, the place where the souls of those who have died in God's
### grace must pay for their sins through suffering before ascending to
### heaven. (2) A place or state of temporary suffering or misery.
### • For both of them, filled with anxiety, the long, sleepless night felt
### like purgatory.
### Purgatory is the place where the soul is cleansed of all impurities, as
### Dante described in his great poem The Divine Comedy. Today
### purgatory can refer to any place or situation in which suffering and
### misery are felt to be sharp but temporary. Waiting to hear the results
### of a test, or whether you got a good job, can be a purgatory. And an
### endless after-dinner speech can make an entire roomful of people
### feel as if they're in purgatory.

## Number Words
### MILL
### means either “a thousand” or “a thousandth.” A millennium is
### a thousand years, and a million is a thousand thousands. But a
### milligram is a thousandth of a gram, a milliliter a thousandth of a
### liter, and a millimeter a thousandth of a meter.

### millefleur
### Having a pattern of small flowers and plants all
### over.
### • She was painstakingly embroidering a millefleur pattern on a pillow
### casing.
### Millefleur came into French from the Latin mille florae (“a thousand
### flowers”), and from French directly into English. You may have seen
### the famed Unicorn Tapestries, in which the unicorn is seen frolicking,
### relaxing, being hunted, and being caught, all against a beautiful
### millefleur background. Italian has given us the similar word
### millefiori; though fiori, like fleurs, means “flowers,” millefiori actually
### refers to a type of multicolored ornamental glass. And the borrowed
### French word mille-feuille (feuille meaning “leaf”) is the name of a
### dish made with puff pastry, the kind of pastry whose flakes resemble
### thin dry leaves.

### millenarianism
### (1) Belief in the 1,000-
### year era of holiness foretold in the Book of Revelation. (2) Belief in
### an ideal society to come, especially one brought about by revolution.
### • Millenarianism is one of the future-oriented beliefs common in the
### New Age movement.
### Originally the millennium was not simply any thousand-year period,
### but instead the thousand years prophesied in the biblical Book of
### Revelation, when holiness will prevail on earth and Jesus Christ will
### preside over all. Later, millennium was extended to mean any period
### —always in the future—marked by universal happiness and human
### perfection. On several occasions over the centuries, members of
### Christian sects have become convinced that the biblical millennium
### was arriving and gathered together to await it. But nonreligious
### millenarians have also believed in a future society marked by human
### perfection. Even if they regard this future as certain, they've
### generally been willing to help it along by working for a political,
### social, or economic revolution. The millennium always seems to be
### approaching; to date, it hasn't arrived.

### millipede
### Any of a class of many-footed arthropods
### that have a cylindrical, segmented body with two pairs of legs on
### each segment, and, unlike centipedes, no poison fangs.
### • As they turned over rocks and bricks in their search for the lost
### bracelet, millipedes of various sizes went scurrying off.
### The earth is home to about 10,000 species of millipedes. Though
### they have no poison fangs, many of them can, when threatened,
### emit a liquid or gas poisonous to their enemies. If their structure
### were true to their name, millipedes would have a thousand legs, but
### in fact they have far fewer. Even so, a millipede in motion is a sight
### to ponder: How can it possibly coordinate all those legs so that it
### doesn't trip over itself? Like some tiny conga line or bunny hop, it
### scuttles away to a rhythm only it can hear.

### millisecond
### One thousandth of a second.
### • A lightning bolt lasts only about 20 milliseconds, though the image
### may stay in one's eye for much longer.
### A millisecond isn't long enough for the blink of an eye, but a few
### milliseconds may determine the winner of a swim race or a hundred-
### yard dash. With the ever-increasing speed of modern technology,
### even a millisecond has started to seem a little sluggish; computer
### operations are now measured in nanoseconds—that is, billionths of a
### second.

### HEMI/SEMI
### means “half.” Hemi- comes from Greek, semi- from
### Latin. A hemisphere is half a sphere, and a semicircle is half a circle.
### (The French prefix demi-, which probably developed from Latin as
### well, also means “half”—as in demitasse, a little after-dinner coffee
### cup half the size of a regular cup.)

### semitone
### The tone at a half step.
### • The ancient piano in the great music room had been allowed to fall
### terribly out of tune, with every note at least a semitone flat.
### A semitone (sometimes called a half tone or a half step) is the
### distance from a white key to a neighboring black key on the piano
### keyboard—for example, from G to G-sharp or from E to E-flat. In an
### octave (from G to the next G above, for instance), there are twelve
### semitones. Semitones are the smallest intervals that are used
### intentionally in almost any of the music you'll normally hear. Two
### semitones equal a whole tone—the distance from G up to A or from
### E down to D, for example.

### semicolon
### The punctuation mark ; , used chiefly
### to separate major sentence elements such as independent clauses.
### • Some young vandal had done a search-and-replace on Mr. Marsh's
### computer file, and in place of every semicolon was the mysterious
### message “Hendrix RULES!”
### The semicolon was introduced into modern type by an Italian printer
### around 1566. But since it's actually the same symbol as the ancient
### Greek question mark, it's older than the colon (:), which first
### appears around 1450. Don't mix the two up. A colon introduces
### something: usually a list, sometimes a statement. A semicolon
### separates two independent but related clauses; it may also replace
### the comma to separate items in a complicated list.

### hemiplegia
### Total or partial paralysis of one side of
### the body that results from disease of or injury to the motor centers
### of the brain.
### • She's starting to regain the use of her right hand, and some of the
### therapists think her hemiplegia might eventually be reversed.
### Hemi-, unlike semi, almost always appears in scientific or technical
### words, including medical terms such as this one. A hemiplegic, like a
### paraplegic (who has lost the use of both legs), has usually suffered
### brain damage, often from a wound or blood clot. Other conditions
### that affect one side of the body are hemihypertrophy (excessive
### growth on one side), hemiatrophy (wasting on one side), and
### hemiparesis (weakness or partial paralysis).

### semiconductor
### A solid that conducts
### electricity like a metal at high temperatures and insulates like a
### nonmetal at low temperatures.
### • Silicon, which makes up 25% of the earth's crust, is the most
### widely used semiconductor, and as such has formed the basis for a
### revolution in human culture.
### A semiconductor is a crystal material whose ability to conduct
### electricity rises as its temperature goes up. That is, it sometimes
### acts as a conductor and sometimes as an insulator. Its conducting
### ability can be much increased by chemical treatment. A
### manufactured chip of silicon, less than half an inch square, may
### contain millions of microscopic transistors, which can serve control
### and memory functions when installed in a computer, automobile, cell
### phone, DVD player, or microwave oven.
