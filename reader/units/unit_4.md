### VOR
### comes from the Latin verb vorare, “to eat,” and the ending -
### ivorous shows up in words that refer to eaters of certain kinds of
### food. Frugivorous (for “fruit-eating”), granivorous (for “grain-
### eating”), and graminivorous (for “grass-eating”) aren't too rare, but
### you won't run across phytosuccivorous (“plant-sap-eating”) every
### day.

### carnivorous
### Meat-eating or flesh-eating.
### • He'd gotten tired of his vegetarian guinea pigs and decided he
### preferred carnivorous pets such as ferrets.
### The order of mammals that Linnaeus named the Carnivora includes
### such families as the dogs, the bears, the raccoons, the weasels, the
### hyenas, the cats, and the seals. Most carnivores eat only meat in the
### wild, but some have varied diets; some bears, for instance, normally
### eat far more vegetation than meat. Carnivores have powerful jaws
### and complex teeth, and most are highly intelligent. Humans, like
### their ape cousins, are basically omnivores (see
### omnivore
### ).

### herbivorous
### Plant-eating.
### • In spite of their frightening appearance, marine iguanas are
### peaceable herbivorous animals that feed mostly on seaweed.
### Many herbivorous animals, such as rabbits, deer, sheep, and cows,
### are noted for their gentle and passive ways. But such behavior is not
### universal among herbivores. Rhinoceroses and elephants, for
### instance, are capable of inflicting serious damage if threatened, and
### among dinosaurs, the herbivorous Diplodocus had a thick tail that
### could be used as a lethal weapon against attacking carnivores.
### Herbivorous humans are usually called vegetarians.

### insectivorous
### Feeding on insects.
### • Their rather odd 12-year-old son kept insectivorous plants in his
### bedroom and fed them live flies.
### A wide variety of animals could be called insectivores—most of the
### birds, for example, as well as the spiders. Of the amphibians, frogs
### and many lizards are largely insectivorous. Even some fish get much
### of their food from insects. The order of mammals called Insectivora
### contains the shrews, moles, and hedgehogs, though bats and
### anteaters are also insectivores. Many insects are themselves
### insectivores; the dragonfly, for instance, is a swift insectivorous
### terror that lives up to its name. But it's the insectivorous plants that
### tend to fascinate us; of the over 600 species, the best known are the
### Venus flytrap (which snaps shut on its prey), the pitcher plants
### (which drown insects in a tiny pool of water), and the sundews
### (which capture insects with their sticky surfaces).

### voracious
### Having a huge appetite.
### • One of the hardest parts of dieting is watching skinny people with
### voracious appetites consume large amounts of food without gaining
### weight.
### Voracious can be applied to people, animals, and even things, and
### doesn't always refer to consuming food. Thus, teenagers are
### voracious eaters; you may become a voracious reader on vacation;
### and Americans have long been voracious consumers. The most
### voracious bats may eat three-quarters of their weight in insects in a
### single night. Some countries have a voracious appetite for oil.
### Voracious corporations keep “swallowing” other companies through
### mergers.

### CARN
### comes from a Latin word meaning “flesh” or “meat.”
### Carnation originally meant “the color of flesh,” which was once the
### only color of the flower we call the carnation. In Christian countries,
### Lent is the period when the faithful traditionally give up something
### they love, often meat. The days leading up to Lent are known as the
### carnival season, from the Italian carnelevare, later shortened to
### carnevale, which meant “removal of meat”—though during carnival,
### of course, people indulge in just about everything, and the removal
### of meat only comes later.

### carnage
### Great destruction of life (as in a battle); slaughter.
### • Countries around the world appealed to all sides of the conflict to
### stop the carnage of the war in Bosnia.
### This word was taken over straight from French (a Latin-based
### language), and has mostly referred to large-scale killing in wartime.
### But carnage needn't refer only to slaughter on the battlefield. With
### tens of thousands of people dying each year in automobile
### accidents, it's appropriate to speak of carnage on the nation's
### highways. And those concerned about the effects of the violence we
### see constantly on TV and movie screens may refer to that as
### carnage as well.

### carnal
### Having to do with bodily pleasures.
### • The news stories about students on Spring Break tend to focus on
### the carnal pleasures associated with the annual ritual.
### In Christianity in past centuries, carnal was often used as the
### opposite of spiritual, describing what are sometimes called “the
### pleasures of the flesh.” Thus, gluttony—the consumption of
### excessive food and drink—was a deadly carnal sin, whereas the
### holiest monks and hermits might eat hardly anything and never
### touch wine. Today carnal has a somewhat old-fashioned sound;
### when we use it, we generally mean simply “sexual.”

### incarnate
### Given bodily or actual form; especially,
### having human body.
### • For the rest of his life, he would regard his childhood nanny as
### goodness incarnate.
### Incarnate often has a religious ring to it, since for centuries it has
### been used in the Christian church, which regards Jesus as the
### incarnation of God—that is, as God made human. Surprisingly,
### neither word appears in Bible translations; instead, the Latin word
### incarnatus appears in the Christian creeds (basic statements of
### belief) and the Catholic Mass. Regardless, incarnate soon began to
### be used with various nouns: “the devil incarnate,” “evil incarnate,”
### etc. Notice that incarnate is one of the rare adjectives that usually,
### but not always, follows its noun. Incarnate is also a verb, though
### with a slightly different pronunciation: “This report simply incarnates
### the prejudices of its authors,” “For her followers, she incarnates the
### virtue of selflessness,” etc.

### reincarnation
### (1) Rebirth in new bodies or
### forms of life. (2) Someone who has been born again with a new
### body after death.
### • Even as a child he struck everyone as a reincarnation of his
### grandfather, not in his features but in his manner and personality.
### It's easy to make fun of people who claim to be the reincarnation of
### Cleopatra or Napoleon, but they don't come from a culture that
### takes reincarnation seriously. In Hindu belief, a person must pass
### through a series of reincarnations—some of which may be as insects
### or fish—before fully realizing that the bodily pleasures are shallow
### and that only spiritual life is truly valuable; only then do the
### reincarnations cease. For Hindus, an “old soul” is a person who
### seems unusually wise from early in life, and whose wisdom must
### have come from passing through many reincarnations.

### CRED
### comes from credere, the Latin verb meaning “to believe” or
### “to entrust.” We have a good credit rating when institutions trust in
### our ability to repay a loan, and we carry credentials so that others
### will believe that we are who we say we are.

### credence
### Mental acceptance of something as true or
### real; belief.
### • He scoffed and said no one still gives any credence to the story of
### the Loch Ness monster.
### Credence is close in meaning to belief, but there are differences.
### Unlike belief, credence is seldom used in connection with faith in a
### religion or philosophy. Instead credence is often used in reference to
### reports, rumors, and opinions. And, unlike belief, it tends to be used
### with the words give, lack, lend,and gain. So a new piece of evidence
### may lend credence to the alibi of a criminal suspect. Claims that a
### political candidate can become the next President gain credence only
### after the candidate wins a few primaries. And although stories about
### Elvis sightings persist, they lack credence for most people.

### credible
### (1) Able to be believed; reasonable to trust or
### believe. (2) Good enough to be effective.
### • Because of her past criminal record, the defense lawyers knew she
### wouldn't be a credible witness.
### Credible evidence is evidence that's likely to be believed. A credible
### plan is one that might actually work, and a credible excuse is one
### your parents might actually believe. And just as credible means
### “believable,” the noun credibility means “believability.” (But we no
### longer use incredible to mean the literal opposite of credible, just as
### we no longer use unbelievable as the literal opposite of believable.)
### Since cred is short for credibility, “street cred” is the kind of
### credibility among tough young people that you can only get by
### proving yourself on the mean streets of the inner city.

### credulity
### Readiness and willingness to believe on the
### basis of little evidence.
### • Thrillers and action movies only succeed if they don't strain our
### credulity too much.
### A particularly far-fetched story may be said to strain credulity,
### stretch credulity, put demands on our credulity, or make claims on
### our credulity. Credulity is a quality of innocent children (of all ages)
### and isn't always a bad thing; it must have been pure credulity that
### enabled Chicago White Sox and Philadelphia Phillies fans to wait so
### long for a World Series victory (“This is the year they're going to
### take it!”), which probably made life bearable for them. The related
### adjective is credulous. F. Scott Fitzgerald once defined advertising as
### “making dubious promises to a credulous public.”

### credo
### (1) A statement of the basic beliefs of a religious
### faith. (2) A set of guiding principles or beliefs.
### • She claims she made her money on Wall Street just by following
### the old credo “Buy low, sell high.”
### Credo comes straight from the Latin word meaning “I believe,” and is
### the first word of many religious credos, or creeds, such as the
### Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed. But the word can be applied
### to any guiding principle or set of principles. Of course, you may
### choose a different credo when you're 52 than when you're 19. But
### here is the credo of the writer H. L. Mencken, written after he had
### lived quite a few years: “I believe that it is better to tell the truth
### than to lie. I believe that it is better to be free than to be a slave.
### And I believe that it is better to know than to be ignorant.”

### FID
### comes from fides, the Latin word for “faith” or “trust.” Fidelity is
### another word for “faithfulness.” Confidence is having faith in
### someone or something. An infidel is someone who lacks a particular
### kind of religious faith. And the once-popular dog's name Fido is Latin
### for “I trust.”

### affidavit
### A sworn statement made in writing.
### • The whole family had signed affidavits stating that they believed
### the will to be valid.
### In Latin, affidavit means “he (she) has sworn an oath,” and an
### affidavit is always a sworn written document. If it contains a lie, the
### person making it may be prosecuted. Affidavits are often used in
### court when it isn't possible for someone to appear in person. Police
### officers must usually file an affidavit with a judge to get a search
### warrant.
### Affidavits
### (unlike
### similar
### signed
### statements
### called
### depositions) are usually made without an opposing lawyer being
### present and able to ask questions.

### diffident
### Lacking confidence; timid, cautious.
### • He always found it a struggle to get his most diffident students to
### speak in front of the class.
### Diffident means lacking faith in oneself—in other words, the opposite
### of confident. Distrust in your abilities or opinions usually makes you
### hesitate to speak or act. Patients who feel diffident around their
### doctors, for example, don't dare ask them many questions. A helpful
### friend tries to instill confidence in place of diffidence.

### fiduciary
### (1) Having to do with a confidence or
### trust. (2) Held in trust for another.
### • Pension-fund managers have a fiduciary responsibility to invest the
### pension's funds for the sole benefit of those who will receive the
### pensions.
### A fiduciary relationship is one in which one person places faith in
### another. Stockbrokers and real-estate agents have fiduciary duties to
### their clients, which means they must act in their clients' best
### financial interests. Members of a company's board of directors have
### a fiduciary responsibility to protect the financial interests of the
### company's shareholders. There are legal requirements for those with
### fiduciary responsibility, and they can be sued for breach of fiduciary
### duty if they fail.

### perfidy
### Faithlessness, disloyalty, or treachery.
### • While working for the CIA he was lured into becoming a double
### agent, and it seems he paid a high price for his perfidy.
### The perfidious Benedict Arnold plotted with the British to surrender
### West Point to them during the American Revolution—an act that
### made his name a synonym for traitor. In recent years, the perfidy of
### the double agents Aldrich Ames (of the CIA) and Robert Hanssen (of
### the FBI) has become notorious.

### CURR/CURS
### comes from currere, the Latin verb meaning “to run.”
### Although words based on this root don't tend to suggest speed, the
### sense of movement remains. Current, for instance, refers to running
### water in a stream or river, or electrons running through a wire, and
### an excursion is a trip from one place to another.

### concurrent
### Happening or operating at the same
### time.
### • The killer was sentenced to serve three concurrent life terms in
### prison.
### Things that are concurrent usually not only happen at the same time
### but also are similar to each other. So, for example, multitasking
### computers are capable of performing concurrent tasks. When we
### take more than one medication at a time, we run the risks involved
### with concurrent drug use. And at any multiplex theater several
### movies are running concurrently.

### cursory
### Hastily and often carelessly done.
### • Having spent the weekend going to parties, she had only given the
### chapter a cursory reading before class on Monday.
### Unlike the other words in this section, cursory always implies speed.
### But it also stresses a lack of attention to detail. Cursory observations
### are generally shallow or superficial because of their speed. And
### when citizens complain about a cursory police investigation of a
### crime, they're distressed by its lack of thoroughness, not its speed.

### discursive
### Passing from one topic to another.
### • Some days he allowed himself to write long discursive essays in his
### diary instead of his usual simple reporting of the day's events.
### The Latin verb discurrere meant “to run about,” and from this word
### we get our word discursive, which often means rambling about over
### a wide range of topics. A discursive writing style generally isn't
### encouraged by writing teachers. But some of the great 19th-century
### writers, such as Charles Lamb and Thomas de Quincey, show that
### the discursive essay, especially when gracefully written and
### somewhat personal in tone, can be a pleasure to read. And the man
### often called the inventor of the essay, the great Michel de
### Montaigne, might touch on dozens of different topics in the course
### of a long discursive essay.

### precursor
### One that goes before and indicates the
### coming of another.
### • Scientists are trying to identify special geological activity that may
### be a precursor to an earthquake, which will help them predict the
### quake's size, time, and location.
### With its prefix pre-, meaning “before,” a precursor is literally a
### “forerunner,” and in fact forerunner first appeared as the translation
### of the Latin praecursor. But the two words function a little differently
### today. A forerunner may simply come before another thing, but a
### precursor generally paves the way for something. So, for example,
### the Office of Strategic Services in World War II was the immediate
### precursor of today's Central Intelligence Agency, while the blues
### music of the 1930s and 1940s was only one of the precursors of the
### rock and roll of today.

### PED
### comes from the Latin word for “foot.” A pedal is pushed by the
### foot; a pedicure is a treatment of the feet, toes, and toenails; and a
### pedestal is what a statue stands on—in a sense, its foot.

### quadruped
### An animal having four feet.
### • She always tells her friends that their farm has five kinds of
### quadrupeds: sheep, goats, cows, horses, and pigs.
### The quadrupeds include almost all the mammals. (Among the
### exceptions are whales, bats, and humans.) The Greek equivalent of
### this Latin word is tetrapod. However, the two are not identical, since
### the tetrapod classification includes bipeds such as birds, in which
### two of the limbs are no longer used for walking. Insects all have six
### legs, of course, and in the sea there are eight-legged octopods
### (including the octopus). But there are no animals of any kind with an
### odd number of legs.

### pedigree
### The line of ancestors of a person or animal.
### • She talks a lot about her pedigree, but never mentions that a
### couple of her uncles spent time in prison.
### What does someone's ancestry have to do with feet? Because
### someone once thought that a family tree, or genealogical chart,
### resembled a crane's foot (in French, pied de grue), even though
### cranes' feet only have four talons or claws, no more than any other
### bird, while a family tree may have hundreds of branches. The word
### pedigree is usually used for purebred animals—cats, racehorses, and
### dogs, as well as livestock such as cows and sheep. Some people
### continue to believe that “purity” in human family trees is a good
### thing as well, though most of us find the idea a little creepy.

### impediment
### Something that interferes with
### movement or progress.
### • Her poorly developed verbal ability was the most serious
### impediment to her advancement.
### Impediment comes from a Latin verb that meant “to interfere with”
### or “to get in the way of progress,” as if by tripping up the feet of
### someone walking. In English, impediment still suggests an
### obstruction or obstacle along a path; for example, a lack of
### adequate roads and bridges would be called an impediment to
### economic development. Impediments usually get in the way of
### something we want. So we may speak of an impediment to
### communication, marriage, or progress—but something that slows
### the progress of aging, disease, or decay is rarely called an
### impediment.

### pedestrian
### Commonplace,
### ordinary,
### or
### unimaginative.
### • While politicians endlessly discussed the great issues facing Russia,
### the Russians worried about such pedestrian concerns as finding
### enough food, shelter, and clothing.
### Most of us know pedestrian as a noun meaning someone who
### travels on foot. But the adjective sense of pedestrian as defined here
### is actually its original meaning. To be pedestrian was to be drab or
### dull, as if plodding along on foot rather than speeding on horseback
### or by coach. Pedestrian is often used to describe a colorless or
### lifeless writing style, but it can also describe politicians, public tastes,
### personal qualities, or possessions. In comparison with the elaborate
### stage shows put on by today's rock artists, for instance, most of the
### stage presentations of 1960s rock stars seem pedestrian.

### FLECT
### comes from flectere, the Latin verb meaning “to bend.” The
### root sometimes takes the form flex-. Things that are flexible can be
### bent, and when you flex a muscle, you're usually bending a limb—
### which, as a trainer at the gym will tell you, requires the use of flexor
### muscles.

### deflect
### To turn aside, especially from a straight or fixed
### course.
### • The stealth technology used on bombers and fighter jets works by
### deflecting radar energy, making them “invisible.”
### Use of the physical meaning of deflect is common. Thus, a soccer
### goalie's save might involve deflecting the ball rather than catching it,
### and workers wear eye shields to deflect tiny particles flying out of
### machines. But the nonphysical meaning may be even more common.
### A Hollywood actress might deflect criticism about her personal life by
### giving lavishly to charity, for example, and we've all tried to change
### the subject to deflect a question we really didn't want to answer.

### reflective
### (1) Capable of reflecting light, images, or sound
### waves. (2) Thoughtful.
### • He likes action movies and going out drinking with friends, but
### when you get to know him you realize he's basically reflective and
### serious.
### Reflective people are people who reflect on things—that is, look back
### at things that have been done or said in order to think calmly and
### quietly about them. Most reflective people would agree with
### Socrates that (as he told the jury that would soon sentence him to
### death) “The unexamined life is not worth living.” Reflective people
### tend to be a bit philosophical and intellectual. But almost everyone
### has reflective moods; gazing into a fireplace or a campfire seems to
### do it to almost everyone.

### genuflect
### To kneel on one knee and then rise as an
### act of respect.
### • At religious shrines in China, pilgrims may not only genuflect but
### actually lie down flat on the ground.
### Genuflection, which contains the root genu-, “knee,” has long been a
### mark of respect and obedience. King Arthur's Knights of the Round
### Table genuflected not only when he knighted them but whenever
### they greeted him formally, and this custom remains in countries
### today that are still ruled by royalty. In some churches, each
### worshipper is expected to genuflect whenever entering or leaving a
### pew on the central aisle.

### inflection
### (1) A change in the pitch, tone, or
### loudness of the voice. (2) The change in form of a word showing its
### case, gender, number, person, tense, mood, voice, or comparison.
### • She couldn't understand her grandfather's words, but she knew
### from his inflection that he was asking a question.
### Changing the pitch, tone, or loudness of our words are ways we
### communicate meaning in speech, though not on the printed page. A
### rising inflection at the end of a sentence generally indicates a
### question, and a falling inflection indicates a statement, for example.
### Another way of inflecting words is by adding endings: -s to make a
### noun plural, -ed to put a verb in the past tense, -er to form the
### comparative form of an adjective, and so on.

### POST
### comes from a Latin word meaning “after” or “behind.” A
### postscript (or PS) is a note that comes after an otherwise completed
### letter, usually as an afterthought. Postpartum refers to the period
### following childbirth, with any related events and complications. To
### postdate a check is to give it a date after the day it was written.

### posterior
### Situated toward or on the back; rear.
### • In a human posterior and dorsal can both refer to the back, but in
### a fish posterior refers to the tail area.
### Posterior comes from the Latin word posterus, meaning “coming
### after.” Posterior is often used as a technical term in biology and
### medicine to refer to the back side of things, and is the opposite of
### anterior, which refers to the front side. For example, as more people
### took up running as a sport, doctors began to see an increase in
### stress fractures along the posterior as well as the anterior surface of
### the lower leg bones. In some technical fields, posterior may mean
### “later.” When used as a noun, posterior simply means “buttocks.”

### posthumous
### (1) Published after the death of the
### author. (2) Following or happening after one's death.
### • Though Van Gogh scarcely sold a single painting during his
### lifetime, he rose to posthumous fame as one of the world's great
### artists.
### Posthumous fame is fame that comes a little late. In fact, its original
### meaning in English is “born after the death of the father.” Bill Clinton
### was the posthumous son of a father who died in an automobile
### accident. The word is now mostly used of artistic works that appear
### after the death of the artist, or the changing reputation of a dead
### artist. Such posthumous works as Herman Melville's Billy Budd, the
### diary of Anne Frank, and almost all the poetry of Emily Dickinson
### have become legendary, and in each case they had a major
### influence on the writer's reputation.

### postmodern
### Having to do with a movement in
### architecture, art, or literature that is a reaction against modernism
### and that reintroduces traditional elements and techniques in odd
### contexts as well as elements from popular culture.
### • The postmodern AT&T building in New York, with the
### “Chippendale” top that reminds viewers of an antique dresser,
### aroused a storm of criticism.
### With its prefix post-, postmodern describes a movement that has
### reacted against modernism. Modernism, dating from around the
### start of the 20th century, represented a sharp break from 19th-
### century styles. But in the 1970s architects began to be dissatisfied
### with the stark simplicity of most modern architecture and began
### including in their mostly modern designs such traditional elements as
### columns, arches, and keystones and sometimes startling color
### contrasts such as might have come from advertising and pop
### culture. In art and literature, as in architecture, postmodernism often
### seems to be making fun of tradition, especially by denying that
### there's any real distinction between serious and popular art or
### writing. Wherever it has shown up, postmodernism has been
### greeted with a mixture of approval, disapproval, and sometimes
### amusement.

### postmortem
### (1) Occurring after death. (2)
### Following the event.
### • In their postmortem discussion of the election, the reporters tried
### to explain how the polls and predictions could have been so
### completely wrong.
### Post mortem is Latin for “after death.” In English, postmortem refers
### to an examination, investigation, or process that takes place after
### death. A postmortem examination of a body (often simply called a
### postmortem) is often needed to determine the time and cause of
### death; the stiffening called rigor mortis is one postmortem change

## Words from Mythology
### calypso
### A folk song or style of singing of West Indian
### origin that has a lively rhythm and words that are often made up by
### the singer.
### • If you take a Caribbean vacation in December, you end up listening
### to a lot of Christmas carols played to a calypso beat.
### In Homer's Odyssey, the nymph Calypso detains Odysseus for seven
### years on his way home from the Trojan War, using all her wiles to
### hold him on her lush island. For many people, the calypso music of
### the West Indian islands, which was eventually brought to America by
### singers such as the Andrews Sisters and later Harry Belafonte, has
### some of the same captivating power as the nymph, though the lyrics
### that are often improvised to the melodies tend to make fun of local
### people and happenings. The original name for these songs, however,
### actually seems to be based on a similar-sounding African word, for
### which, early in the 20th century, someone began substituting this
### name from Greek mythology.

### odyssey
### (1) A long, wandering journey full of trials and
### adventures. (2) A spiritual journey or quest.
### • Their six-month camping trip around the country was an odyssey
### they would always remember.
### Odysseus, the hero of Homer's Odyssey, spends 20 years traveling
### home from the Trojan War. He has astonishing adventures and
### learns a great deal about himself and the world; he even descends
### to the underworld to talk to the dead. Thus, an odyssey is any long,
### complicated journey, often a quest for a goal, and may be a spiritual
### or psychological journey as well as an actual voyage.

### palladium
### A precious, silver-white metal related to
### platinum that is used in electrical contacts and as an alloy with gold
### to form white gold.
### • Most wedding rings today are simple bands of gold, platinum, or
### palladium.
### Pallas Athena was one of the poetical names given to the Greek
### goddess Athena (although it's no longer clear what Pallas was
### supposed to mean), and the original palladium was a statue of
### Athena that was believed to have the power to protect the ancient
### city of Troy. When an asteroid belt was discovered between Mars
### and Jupiter, most of the asteroids were named after figures in Greek
### mythology, and one of the first to be discovered was named Pallas in
### 1803. In the same year, scientists isolated a new silvery metal
### element, which they named palladium in honor of the recently
### discovered asteroid.

### Penelope
### A modest domestic wife.
### • Critics of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 1990s would perhaps have
### preferred her to be a Penelope, quietly tending the White House and
### staying out of politics.
### In the Odyssey, Penelope waits 20 long years for her husband
### Odysseus to return from Troy. During that time, she must raise their
### son and fend off the attentions of numerous rough suitors. She
### preserves herself for a long time by saying she cannot remarry until
### she has finished weaving a funeral shroud for her aging father-in-
### law; however, what she weaves each day she secretly unravels each
### night. A Penelope thus appears to be the perfect, patient, faithful
### wife (and may be using her clever intelligence to keep herself that
### way).

### procrustean
### Ruthlessly disregarding individual
### differences or special circumstances.
### • The school's procrustean approach seemed to assume that all
### children learned in the same way and at the same rate.
### In the Greek tale of the hero Theseus, Procrustes was a bandit who
### ambushed travelers and, after robbing them, made them lie on an
### iron bed. To make sure they “fit” this bed, he would cut off the parts
### that hung off the ends or stretch the body if it was too short; either
### way, the unlucky traveler always died. When he made the mistake of
### confronting Theseus, Procrustes was made to “fit” his own bed.
### Something procrustean takes no account of individual differences
### but cruelly and mercilessly makes everything the same.

### protean
### (1) Displaying great versatility or variety. (2)
### Able to take on many different forms or natures.
### • A protean athlete, he left college with offers from the professional
### leagues to play baseball, football, and basketball.
### As the story is told in the Odyssey, at the end of the Trojan War the
### sea god Proteus revealed to King Menelaus of Sparta how to get
### home from Troy with his unfaithful wife, the beautiful Helen of Troy.
### Before Proteus would give up the information, though, Menelaus had
### to capture him—no mean feat, since Proteus had the ability to
### change into any natural shape he chose. The word protean came to
### describe this ability to change into many different shapes or to play
### many different roles in quick succession.

### sibyl
### A female prophet or fortune-teller.
### • The villagers told him about an aged woman who lived alone in a
### hut on a nearby mountain, a sibyl who knew the future and would
### prophesy under the right conditions.
### Ancient writers refer to the existence of various women in such
### countries as Babylonia, Greece, Italy, and Egypt, through whom the
### gods regularly spoke. These sibyls were easy to confuse with the
### oracles, women who were likewise mouthpieces of the gods, at such
### sites as Apollo's temple at Delphi. The most famous sibyl was the
### Sibyl of Cumae in Italy, a withered crone who lived in a cave. Her
### prophecies were collected into twelve books, three of which survived
### to be consulted by the Romans in times of national emergencies.
### She is one of the five sibyls memorably depicted by Michelangelo on
### the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

### siren
### A woman who tempts men with bewitching
### sweetness.
### • Reporters treated her like a sex symbol, but she lacked the
### graceful presence and air of mystery of a real siren.
### The sirens were a group of partly human female creatures that lured
### sailors onto destructive rocks with their singing. Odysseus and his
### men encountered the sirens on their long journey home from Troy.
### The only way to sail by them safely was to make oneself deaf to
### their enchanting song, so Odysseus packed the men's ears with wax,
### while he himself, ever curious, kept his ears open but had himself
### tied to the mast to keep from flinging himself into the water or
### steering his ship toward sure destruction in his desire to see them. A
### siren today is a sinister but almost irresistible woman. A siren song,
### however, may be any appeal that lures a person to act against his or
### her better judgment.
