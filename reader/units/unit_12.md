### UMBR
### comes from the Latin umbra, meaning “shadow.” Thus, the
### familiar umbrella, with its ending meaning “little,” casts a “little
### shadow” to keep off the sun or the rain.

### umber
### (1) A darkish brown mineral containing
### manganese and iron oxides used for coloring paint. (2) A color that
### is greenish brown to dark reddish brown.
### • Van Dyke prized umber as a pigment and used it constantly in his
### oil paintings.
### The mineral deposits of Italy provided sources of a number of
### natural pigments, among them umber. Since the late Renaissance,
### umber has been in great demand as a coloring agent. When crushed
### and mixed with paint, it produces an olive color known as raw
### umber; when crushed and burnt, it produces a darker tone known as
### burnt umber.

### adumbrate
### (1) To give a sketchy outline or disclose
### in part. (2) To hint at or foretell.
### • The Secretary of State would only adumbrate his ideas for bringing
### peace to Bosnia.
### A synonym for adumbrate is foreshadow, which means to present a
### shadowy version of something before it becomes reality or is
### provided in full. Tough questioning by a Supreme Court justice may
### adumbrate the way he or she is planning to rule on a case. A bad
### review by a critic may adumbrate the failure of a new film. And rats
### scurrying off a ship were believed to adumbrate a coming disaster at
### sea.

### penumbra
### (1) The partial shadow surrounding a
### complete shadow, as in an eclipse. (2) The fringe or surrounding
### area where something exists less fully.
### • This area of the investigation was the penumbra where both the
### FBI and the CIA wanted to pursue their leads.
### Every solar eclipse casts an umbra, the darker central area in which
### almost no light reaches the earth, and a penumbra, the area of
### partial shadow where part of the sun is still visible. Penumbra can
### thus be used to describe any “gray area” where things aren't all
### black and white. For example, the right to privacy falls under the
### penumbra of the U.S. Constitution; though it isn't specifically
### guaranteed there, the Supreme Court has held that it is implied, and
### thus that the government may not intrude into certain areas of a
### citizen's private life. Because its existence is still shadowy, however,
### the Court is still determining how much of an individual's life is
### protected by the right to privacy.

### umbrage
### A feeling of resentment at some slight or insult,
### often one that is imagined rather than real.
### • She often took umbrage at his treatment of her, without being able
### to pinpoint what was offensive about it.
### An umbrage was originally a shadow, and soon the word also began
### to mean “a shadowy suspicion.” Then it came to mean “displeasure”
### as well—that is, a kind of shadow blocking the sunlight. Umbrage is
### now generally used in the phrase “take umbrage at.” An overly
### sensitive person may take umbrage at something as small as having
### his or her name pronounced wrong.

### VEST
### comes from the Latin verb vestire, “to clothe” or “to dress,”
### and the noun vestis, “clothing” or “garment.” Vest is the shortest
### English word we have from this root, and is the name of a rather
### small piece of clothing.

### divest
### (1) To get rid of or free oneself of property,
### authority, or title. (2) To strip of clothing, ornaments, or equipment.
### • In protest against apartheid, many universities in the 1980s
### divested themselves of all stock in South African companies.
### If you decide to enter a monastery, you may divest yourself of most
### of your possessions. When a church is officially abandoned, it's
### usually divested of its ornaments and furnishings. A company that's
### going through hard times may divest itself of several stores, and
### investors are constantly divesting themselves of stocks that aren't
### performing well enough. And when it turns out that athletes have
### been using steroids, they're usually divested of any awards they may
### have won.

### investiture
### The formal placing of someone in
### office.
### • At an English monarch's investiture, he or she is presented with
### the crown, scepter, and sword, the symbols of power.
### In its original meaning, an investiture was the clothing of a new
### officeholder in garments that symbolized power. The Middle Ages
### saw much debate over the investiture of bishops by kings and
### emperors. These rulers felt that high religious offices were theirs to
### give as rewards for someone's loyal service or as bribes for
### someone's future support; the popes, on the other hand, regarded
### these investitures as the improper buying and selling of church
### offices. The investiture struggle caused tension between popes and
### monarchs and even led to wars.

### transvestite
### A person, especially a male, who
### wears the clothing and adopts the mannerisms of the opposite sex.
### • In Handel's operas, the heroic male leading roles are today often
### sung by female transvestites, since he originally wrote them for the
### soprano range.
### Transvestite includes the prefix trans-, “across,” and thus means
### literally “cross-dresser.” In the theater, from ancient Greece to
### Elizabethan England, transvestism was common because all parts—
### even Juliet—were played by men. Traditional Japanese Kabuki and
### Noh drama still employ transvestism of this sort. In everyday life, it's
### now so acceptable for women to wear men's clothing that the word
### transvestite is generally applied only to men. The much newer word
### transgender describes people who think of themselves as having
### changed sex, or who simply don't believe in the idea that they're
### either one sex or the other.

### travesty
### (1) An inferior or distorted imitation. (2) A
### broadly comic imitation in drama, literature, or art that is usually
### grotesque and ridiculous.
### • The senator was shouting that the new tax bill represented a
### travesty of tax reform.
### The word travesty comes from the same prefix and root as
### transvestite. Since cross-dressing often isn't very convincing, the
### word has usually referred to something absurd. So a verdict that
### angers people may be denounced as a “travesty of justice.” Saturday
### Night Live specializes in dramatic travesties mocking everything from
### political figures and issues to popular culture—“disguised” versions
### intended for entertainment. Travesty may also be a verb; thus, Mel
### Brooks has travestied movie genres of all kinds—westerns, thrillers,
### and silent films, among others.

### Answers

### THE/THEO
### comes from the Greek word meaning “god.” Theology,
### the study of religion, is practiced by theologians. Monotheism is the
### worship of a single god; Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are
### monotheistic religions, and all three worship the same god.
### Polytheistic religions such as those of ancient Greece and Rome, on
### the other hand, worship many gods.

### apotheosis
### (1) Transformation into a god. (2)
### The perfect example.
### • Abraham Lincoln's apotheosis after his assassination transformed
### the controversial politician into the saintly savior of his country.
### In ancient Greece, historical figures were sometimes worshipped as
### gods. In Rome, apotheosis was rare until the emperor Augustus
### declared the dead Julius Caesar to be a god, and soon other dead
### emperors were being apotheosized as well. In older paintings you
### may see a heroic figure—Napoleon, George Washington, or
### Shakespeare, for example—being raised into the clouds, symbolizing
### his or her apotheosis. But today any great classic example of
### something can be called its apotheosis. You might hear it said, for
### example, that Baroque music reached its apotheosis in the works of
### J. S. Bach, or that the Duesenberg Phaeton was the apotheosis of
### the touring car.

### atheistic
### Denying the existence of God or divine
### power.
### • The atheistic Madalyn Murray O'Hair successfully sought the
### removal of prayer from American public schools in the 1960s.
### In the Roman Empire, early Christians were called atheistic because
### they denied the existence of the Roman gods. And once the
### Christian church was firmly established, it condemned the Romans
### as atheists because they didn't believe in the Christian God. In later
### centuries, English-speaking Christians would often use the words
### pagan and heathen to describe such non-Christians, while atheist
### would be reserved for those who actually denied the existence of
### any god. Atheism is different from agnosticism, which claims that the
### existence of any higher power is unknowable; and lots of people
### who simply don't think much about religion often call themselves
### agnostics as well.

### pantheon
### (1) A building serving as the burial place
### of or containing memorials to the famous dead of a nation. (2) A
### group of notable persons or things.
### • A Hall of Fame serves as a kind of pantheon for its field, and those
### admitted in the early years are often the greatest of all.
### Each of the important Roman gods and goddesses had many
### temples erected in their name. But in 27 B.C. a temple to all the
### gods together was completed in Rome; twice destroyed, it was
### ultimately replaced by a third temple around A.D. 126. This
### extraordinary domed structure is still one of the important sights of
### Rome, and the burial place for the painters Raphael and Carracci and
### two kings. In Paris, a great church was completed in 1789–90;
### named the Panthéon, it was announced as the future resting place
### of France's great figures, and the bodies of Victor Hugo, Louis
### Pasteur, Marie Curie, and many others now rest within its walls.

### theocracy
### (1) Government by officials who are
### regarded as divinely inspired. (2) A state governed by a theocracy.
### • The ancient Aztecs lived in a theocracy in which guidance came
### directly from the gods through the priests.
### In the Middle Ages, the Muslim empires stretching around much of
### the Mediterranean were theocracies, and the pope ruled most of
### modern-day Italy. But theocracies are rare today. Modern Iran and
### Saudi Arabia (and perhaps half a dozen others) are usually regarded
### as theocratic governments, since, even though Iran's president is
### elected by popular vote and Saudi Arabia is ruled by a royal family,
### the countries' laws are religious laws. But when a government tries
### to follow all the teachings of a single religion, things usually don't
### work out terribly well, so U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights forbid
### using religion as the principal basis for democracy.

### ICON
### comes from the Greek eikon, which led to the Latin icon, both
### meaning “image.” Though the icon- root hasn't produced many
### English words, the words that is does appear in tend to be
### interesting.

### icon
### (1) A religious image usually painted on a small
### wooden panel: idol. (2) Emblem, symbol.
### • Henry Ford's assembly line captured the imagination of the world,
### and he and his company became icons of industrial capitalism.
### In the Eastern Orthodox church, much importance is given to icons,
### usually small portraits on wood—sometimes with gold-leaf paint—of
### Jesus, Mary, or a saint, which hang in churches and in the houses of
### the faithful. The Orthodox church favors icons partly because they
### communicate directly and forcefully even to uneducated people.
### They are regarded as sacred; some believers actually pray to them,
### and many believe that icons have carried out miracles. The common
### modern uses of icon grew out of this original sense. The fact that
### Orthodox icons have a symbolic role led to icon being used to mean
### simply “symbol.” Because of the icon's sacredness, the term also
### came to mean “idol.” And once we began to use idol to refer to pop-
### culture stars, it wasn't long before we began using icon the same
### way. But for the little computer-desktop images that you click on,
### the older meaning of “symbol” is the one we're thinking of.

### iconic
### (1) Symbolic. (2) Relating to a greatly admired and
### successful person or thing.
### • The 1963 March on Washington was the iconic event in the history
### of the civil-rights movement, now familiar to all American
### schoolchildren.
### The original meaning of iconic was essentially “resembling an icon,”
### but today it more often seems to mean “so admired that it could be
### the subject of an icon.” And with that meaning, iconic has become
### part of the language of advertising and publicity; today companies
### and magazines and TV hosts are constantly encouraging us to think
### of some consumer item or pop star or show as first-rate or immortal
### or flawless—absolutely “iconic”—when he or she or it is actually
### nothing of the kind.

### iconoclast
### (1) A person who destroys religious
### images or opposes their use. (2) A person who attacks settled beliefs
### or institutions.
### • She's always rattling her friends by saying outrageous things, and
### she enjoys her reputation as an iconoclast.
### When the early books of the Bible were being written, most of the
### other Middle Eastern religions had more than one god; these
### religions generally encouraged the worship of idols of the various
### gods, which were often regarded as magical objects. But in the Ten
### Commandments given to Moses in the Old Testament, God prohibits
### the making of “graven images” or “idols” for worship, proclaiming
### that the Jews are to worship only one God, who is too great to be
### represented in an idol. However, by the 6th century A.D., Christians
### had begun to create religious images in order to focus the prayers of
### the faithful. Opposition to icons led to the Iconoclastic Controversy in
### A.D. 726, when, supported by the pope, iconoclasts began smashing
### and burning the images in churches and monasteries (clast- comes
### from the Greek word meaning “to break”). In time, peace was
### restored, and almost all Christians have since accepted depictions of
### Jesus, Mary, and the saints. Today an iconoclast is someone who
### constantly argues with conventional thinking, refusing to “worship”
### the objects of everyone else's “faith.”

### iconography
### (1) The imagery and symbolism of a
### work of art or an artist. (2) The study of artistic symbolism.
### • Today scholars pore over the advertisements in glossy magazines,
### studying the iconography for clues to the ads' hidden meanings.
### If you saw a 17th-century painting of a man writing at a desk with a
### lion at his feet, would you know you were looking at St. Jerome,
### translator of the Bible, who, according to legend, once pulled a thorn
### from the paw of a lion, which thereafter became his devoted friend?
### And if a painting showed a young woman reclining on a bed with a
### shower of gold descending on her, would you recognize her as
### Danaë, locked up in a tower to keep her away from the lustful Zeus,
### who then managed to gain access to her by transforming himself
### into golden light (or golden coins)? An iconographic approach to art
### can make museum-going a lot of fun—and amateur iconographers
### know there are also plenty of symbols lurking in the images that
### advertisers bombard us with daily.

### URB
### comes from the Latin noun for “city.” Our word urban describes
### cities and the people who live in them. With its sub- prefix (see
### SUB
### ), a suburb is a town “near” or “under” a larger city, and
### suburban houses are home to suburbanites.

### urbane
### Sophisticated and with polished manners.
### • He was remembered as a gentlemanly and urbane host of elegant
### dinner parties.
### Urbane's synonyms include suave, debonair, and especially
### cosmopolitan. Urbanity was a trait of such classic movie stars as
### Fred Astaire, Cary Grant, William Powell, Leslie Howard, Charles
### Boyer, and George Sanders. (Notice that, for some reason, urbane is
### almost always used to describe men rather than women.) Teenagers
### in the 1960s read James Bond novels and watched his character
### onscreen to get tips about acquiring an urbane identity. But it's hard
### to acquire urbanity without actually having had wide social
### experience in sophisticated cities. And, since times have changed,
### the whole notion doesn't seem to attract young people quite the way
### it used to.

### exurban
### Relating to a region or settlement that lies
### outside a city and usually beyond its suburbs and often is inhabited
### chiefly by well-to-do families.
### • Exurban areas typically show much higher education and income
### levels than closer-in suburbs or nearby rural counties.
### With its prefix ex-, (“outside of,” the noun exurb was coined around
### 1955 to describe the ring of well-off communities beyond the
### suburbs that were becoming commuter towns for an urban area.
### Most exurbs were probably quiet little towns before being discovered
### by young city dwellers with good incomes looking for a pleasant
### place to raise their children. Planners, advertisers, and political
### strategists today often talk about such topics as exurban
### development, exurban trends, exurban migration, and exurban
### voters.

### interurban
### Going between or connecting cities or
### towns.
### • Businesspeople in the two cities have been waiting for decades for
### a true high-speed interurban railway on the Japanese model.
### Interurban is generally used to describe transportation. As a noun
### (as in “In those days you could take the interurban from Seattle to
### Tacoma”), interurban has meant a fairly heavy but fast electric train,
### something between an urban trolley and a full-fledged long-distance
### train, that offers more frequent service than an ordinary railway.
### Interurban transit today may include bus, ferry, and limousine—and,
### in a few lucky areas, a regional railway. With oil supplies dwindling,
### there's hope that interurban railways will be coming back into wider
### use.

### urbanization
### The process by which towns
### and cities are formed and become larger as more and more people
### begin living and working in central areas.
### • The area has been undergoing rapid urbanization, and six or seven
### of the old small towns are now genuine suburbs.
### The word urbanization started appearing in print way back in the
### 1880s, which says something about the growth of American cities.
### The expansion of Los Angeles was an early example of uncontrolled
### urbanization. Urbanization is often seen as a negative trend, with
### bad effects on quality of life and the environment. But apartments
### require much less heat than houses, and commuting by mass transit
### rather than cars can reduce pollution and energy use, and cities
### offer improved opportunities for jobs (and often for education and
### housing as well), so city growth doesn't make everyone unhappy.

### CULT
### comes from the Latin cultus, meaning “care.” So cultivation is
### care of something, such as a garden, in a way that encourages its
### growth. And culture is what is produced by cultivating human
### knowledge, skills, beliefs, manners, science, and art over many
### years.

### acculturation
### (1) Modification of the culture
### of an individual, group, or people by adapting to or borrowing traits
### from another culture. (2) The process by which a human being
### acquires the culture of a particular society from infancy.
### • The old Eastern European bagel has gone through an acculturation
### in America, where it has acquired a soft texture, a white interior, and
### fillers like eggs and peanut butter.
### Whenever people come in close contact with a population that's
### more powerful, they're generally forced to acculturate in order to
### survive. Learning a new language is usually part of the acculturation
### process, which may also include adopting new clothing, a new diet,
### new occupations, and even a new religion. An older generation often
### fails to acculturate thoroughly, but their children often pick up the
### new ways quickly.

### cross-cultural
### Dealing
### with
### or
### offering
### comparison between two or more different cultures or cultural areas.
### • A cross-cultural study of 49 tribes revealed a tight relationship
### between the closeness of mother-infant bonding in a given tribe and
### that tribe's peacefulness toward its neighbors.
### If you've ever traveled in a foreign country, you've found yourself
### making some cross-cultural comparisons: Why are huge family
### dinners so much more common in Italy than back home? Why do
### Mexican teenagers seem to play with their little relatives so much
### more than teenagers in the U.S.? Cross-cultural analysis has
### produced extremely interesting data about such things as the effects
### of various nations' diets on their populations' health. Though cross-
### cultural was originally used by anthropologists to refer to research
### comparing aspects of different cultures, it's also often used to
### describe the reality that lots of us face daily while simply walking the
### streets of a big American city.

### horticulture
### The science and art of growing
### fruits, vegetables, flowers, or ornamental plants.
### • He considered majoring in botany, but has decided instead on
### horticulture, hoping he can spend more time in a greenhouse than in
### the library or the lab.
### Hortus is Latin for “garden,” and the first gardens were planted
### about 10,000 years ago in what is often called the Fertile Crescent—
### the crescent-shaped area stretching from Israel north through Syria
### and down Iraq's two great rivers to the Persian Gulf. Probably more
### fertile in previous centuries than it is today, it was the original home
### of such food plants as wheat, barley, peas, and lentils or their
### ancient ancestors (not to mention the ancestors of cows, pigs,
### sheep, and goats as well). Many horticulturists today work as
### researchers or plant breeders or tend orchards and greenhouses—
### but most American households contain at least one amateur
### horticulturist.

### subculture
### A group whose beliefs and behaviors
### are different from the main groups within a culture or society.
### • Members of the emo subculture at her high school recognized each
### other by their skinny jeans, dyed hair, and canvas sneakers.
### This common meaning of subculture (it has an older biological
### meaning) only appeared in the 1930s, and for about 20 years it was
### used mostly by sociologists, psychologists, and anthropologists. But
### in the 1950s, as America's wealth led to more and more teenagers
### getting their own cars and thus their independence, not to mention
### the arrival of rock 'n' roll, people noticed something unusual
### happening among young people, and began to speak of the “youth
### subculture.” As the country's wealth and freedom of movement
### continued to increase, we realized that the U.S. had become home
### to a large number of subcultures. Today the Web makes possible
### more than anyone could have dreamed of back in the 1950s. When
### we happen to stumble on a subculture—bodybuilders, Trekkies,
### hackers, Airstreamers, anime lovers, motocross enthusiasts—we may
### realize with astonishment that we had never even imagined that it
### might exist.

### DEM/DEMO
### comes from the Greek word meaning “people.”
### “Government by the people” was invented by the ancient Greeks, so
### it's appropriate that they were the first to come up with a word for
### it: demokratia, or democracy.

### demographic
### Having to do with the study of
### human populations, especially their size, growth, density, and
### patterns of living.
### • Each year the state government uses the most current
### demographic figures to determine how to distribute its funding for
### education.
### Demographic
### analysis,
### the
### statistical
### description
### of
### human
### populations, is a tool used by government agencies, political parties,
### and manufacturers of consumer goods. Polls conducted on every
### topic imaginable, from age to toothpaste preference, give the
### government and corporations an idea of who the public is and what
### it needs and wants. The government's census, which is conducted
### every ten years, is the largest demographic survey of all. Today
### demographic is also being used as a noun; so, for example, TV
### advertisers are constantly worrying about how to appeal to “the 18-
### to-24-year-old demographic.”

### endemic
### (1) Found only in a given place or region. (2)
### Often found in a given occupation, area, or environment.
### • Malaria remains endemic in tropical regions around the world.
### With its en- prefix, endemic means literally “in the population.” Since
### the panda is found in the wild exclusively in central China and
### eastern Tibet, scientists say it's “endemic to” those areas. But the
### word can also mean simply “common” or “typical”; so we can say
### that corruption is endemic in the government of a country, that colds
### are “endemic in” nursery school, or that love of Barbie dolls is
### “endemic among” young American girls. Don't confuse endemic with
### epidemic; something can be endemic in a region for centuries
### without ever “exploding.”

### demagogue
### A political leader who appeals to the
### emotions and prejudices of people in order to arouse discontent and
### to advance his or her own political purposes.
### • His supporters called him a “man of the people”; his enemies
### called him a lying demagogue.
### Demagogue was once defined by the writer H. L. Mencken as “one
### who will preach doctrines he knows to be untrue to men he knows
### to be idiots,” and Mencken's definition still works quite well. The
### “doctrines” (ideas) preached by demagogues will naturally always be
### the kind that appeal directly to the ordinary voter, the “common
### man” or “little guy.” Appealing to the common people is not itself a
### bad thing, but it has often been used by those who calculate that
### demagoguery (or demagogy) is the easiest way to power. In most
### countries, fear of demagogic leaders is so strong that voters aren't
### even permitted to vote directly for the nation's leader, but instead
### vote only for a local representative.

### demotic
### Popular or common.
### • Partly because of television, the demotic language and accents of
### America's various regions have become more and more similar.
### For many years demotic was used only to describe the writing of
### ancient Egypt, as the name of the script used by ordinary Egyptians
### rather than by their priests. Demotic is still an intellectual word, but
### it can now be used to describe any popular style in contrast to a
### style associated with a higher class, especially a style of speech or
### writing. So, for example, demotic Californian is different from
### demotic Texan. The most demotic dress today is probably blue jeans
### and sneakers, and those who wear them have demotic taste in
### fashion. The problem is, in American society it can sometimes be
### hard to find a style that can't be described as demotic.

### POPUL
### comes from the Latin word meaning “people,” and in fact
### forms the basis of the word people itself. So the population is the
### people of an area, and popular means not only “liked by many
### people” but also (as in popular culture) “relating to the general
### public.”

### populist
### A believer in the rights, wisdom, or virtues of
### the common people.
### • He knew he would have to campaign as a populist in order to
### appeal to the working-class voters.
### The word populist first appeared in the 1890s with the founding of
### the Populist Party, which stood for the interests of the farmers
### against the big-money interests. In later years populism came to be
### associated with the blue-collar class in the cities as well. Populism
### can be hard to predict. It sometimes has a religious tendency; it
### usually isn't very interested in international affairs; it has sometimes
### been unfriendly to immigrants and blacks; and it's often anti-
### intellectual. So populism often switches between liberal and
### conservative. But the populist style always shows its concern with
### Americans with average incomes as opposed to the rich and
### powerful.

### populace
### (1) The common people or masses. (2)
### Population.
### • Perhaps Henry Ford's major achievement was to manufacture a car
### that practically the entire populace could afford—the Model T.
### Populace is usually used to refer to all the people of a country. Thus,
### we're often told that an educated and informed populace is essential
### for a healthy American democracy. Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous
### radio “Fireside Chats” informed and reassured the American
### populace in the 1930s as we struggled through the Great
### Depression. We often hear about what “the general populace” is
### thinking or doing, but generalizing about something so huge can be
### tricky.

### populous
### Numerous, densely settled, or having a
### large population.
### • Most Americans can't locate Indonesia, the fourth most populous
### country in the world, on a map.
### With a metropolitan area of more than 20 million people, Mexico City
### could be called the world's second or third most populous city. And
### the nearby Aztec city of Tenochtitlán was one of the largest cities in
### the world even when Hernán Cortés arrived there in 1519. But by
### the time Cortés conquered the city in 1521 it wasn't nearly so
### populous, since European diseases had greatly reduced the
### population. Avoid confusing populous and populace, which are
### pronounced exactly the same.

### vox populi
### Popular sentiment or opinion.
### • Successful politicians are always listening to the vox populi and
### adjusting their opinions or language accordingly.
### Dating from at least the time of Charlemagne, the Latin saying “Vox
### populi, vox Dei” means literally “The voice of the people is the voice
### of God”—in other words, the people's voice is sacred, or the people
### are always right. Today, by means of modern opinion polls, we seem
### to hear the vox populi (or vox pop for short) year-round on every
### possible issue. But maybe we should occasionally keep in mind that
### full Charlemagne-era quotation: “Those people should not be
### listened to who keep saying the voice of the people is the voice of
### God, since the riotousness of the crowd is always very close to
### madness.”

## Animal Words
### aquiline
### (1) Relating to eagles. (2) Curving like an
### eagle's beak.
### • The surviving busts of noble Romans show that many of the men
### had strong aquiline noses.
### Aquiline, from the Latin word meaning “eagle,” is most often used to
### describe a nose that has a broad curve and is slightly hooked, like a
### beak. The aquiline figure on the U.S. seal brandishes the arrows of
### war and the olive branch of peace. The word for eagle itself, Aquila,
### has been given to a constellation in the northern hemisphere.

### asinine
### Foolish, brainless.
### • He's not so great when he's sober, but when he's drunk he gets
### truly asinine.
### The donkey, or ass, has often been accused of stubborn, willful, and
### stupid behavior lacking in logic and common sense. Asinine behavior
### exhibits similar qualities. Idiotic or rude remarks, aggressive
### stupidity, and general immaturity can all earn someone (usually a
### man) this description. If you call him this to his face, however, he
### might behave even worse.

### bovine
### (1) Relating to cows and oxen. (2) Placid, dull,
### unemotional.
### • In that part of Texas, many of the veterinarians specialize in bovine
### conditions and won't even deal with dogs or cats.
### Bovine comes from the Latin word for “cow,” though the biological
### family called the Bovidae actually includes not only cows and oxen
### but also goats, sheep, bison, and buffalo. So bovine is often used
### technically, when discussing “bovine diseases,” “bovine anatomy,”
### and so on. It can also describe a human personality, though it can
### be a rather unkind way to describe someone. When Hera, the wife of
### Zeus, is called “cow-eyed,” though, it's definitely a compliment, and
### Zeus fairly melts when she turns those big bovine eyes on him.

### canine
### Relating to dogs or the dog family; doglike.
### • Pleasure in getting their tummies rubbed must be a basic canine
### trait, since all our dogs have loved it.
### Dogs are prized for their talents and intelligence but aren't always
### given credit for their independence. Instead, tales of canine devotion
### and attachment are legendary; the old Lassie and Rin-Tin-Tin
### television series featured at least one heroic act of devotion per
### show. So we often hear people described as having “doglike
### devotion” or “doglike loyalty.” But canine itself, unlike doglike, usually
### refers to four-legged creatures. Canine is not only an adjective but
### also a noun. Dogs and their relatives in the Canidae family—the
### wolves, jackals, foxes, and coyotes—are often called canines. And so
### are those two slightly pointed teeth a bit to the right and left of your
### front teeth.

### feline
### (1) Relating to cats or the cat family. (2) Like a cat in
### being sleek, graceful, sly, treacherous, or stealthy.
### • The performers moved across the high wire with feline grace and
### agility.
### Cats have always provoked a strong reaction from humans. The
### Egyptians worshipped them, leaving thousands of feline mummies
### and idols as evidence. In the Middle Ages, felines were feared as
### agents of the devil, and were thought to creep around silently at
### night doing evil. (Notice that feline is also a noun.) The fascinating
### family called the Felidae includes about 40 species of superb
### hunters, including the lions, tigers, jaguars, cheetahs, cougars,
### bobcats, and lynxes, and almost all of them are smooth, silent, and
### independent.

### leonine
### Relating to lions; lionlike.
### • As he conducted, Leonard Bernstein would fling his leonine mane
### wildly about.
### The Latin word for “lion” is leon, so the names Leon, Leo, and Leona
### all mean “lion” as well. A leonine head usually has magnificent hair,
### like a male lion's mane. The leonine strength of Heracles (Hercules)
### is symbolized by the lion's pelt that he wears, the pelt of the fabled
### Nemean Lion which he had slain as one of his Twelve Labors. But
### leonine courage is what is so notably lacking in The Wizard of Oz's
### Cowardly Lion.

### porcine
### Relating to pigs or swine; piglike.
### • She describes her landlord's shape as porcine, and claims he has
### manners to match.
### Pigs are rarely given credit for their high intelligence or their
### friendliness as pets, but instead are mocked for their habit of cooling
### themselves in mud puddles and the aggressive way they often go
### after food. While porcine isn't as negative a term as swinish, it may
### describe things that are fat, greedy, pushy, or generally piggish—but
### primarily fat. Porky Pig and Miss Piggy aren't particularly porcine in
### their behavior, only in their appearance—that is, pink and pudgy.

### vulpine
### (1) Relating to foxes; foxlike. (2) Sneaky, clever,
### or crafty; foxy.
### • She'd already decided she didn't like anything about him, especially
### the twitchiness, that vulpine face, and those darting eyes.
### Foxes may be sleek and graceful runners with beautiful coats and
### tails, but they're almost impossible to keep out of the henhouse.
### Over the centuries they have “outfoxed” countless farmers. Because
### of the quick intelligence in their faces and their cunning nighttime
### raids, vulpine today almost always describes a face or manner that
### suggests a person capable of the same kind of sly scheming.
