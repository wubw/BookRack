### VIS
### comes from a Latin verb meaning “see.” Vision is what enables
### us to see, visual images are visible to our eyes, and a visitor is
### someone who comes to see something. The same verb actually
### gives us another root, vid-, as in Julius Caesar's famous statement
### about his military exploits, “Veni, vidi, vici” (“I came, I saw, I
### conquered”), and such common English words as video.

### vista
### (1) A distant view. (2) An extensive mental view, as
### over a stretch of time.
### • The economic vista for the next two years looks excellent,
### according to a poll of business economists.
### Vista is generally used today for broad sweeping views of the kind
### you might see from a mountaintop. But the word originally meant an
### avenue-like view, narrowed by a line of trees on either side. And
### vista has also long been used (like view and outlook) to mean a
### mental scan of the future—as if you were riding down a long grand
### avenue and what you could see a mile or so ahead of you was
### where you'd be in the very near future.

### vis-à-vis
### In relation to or compared with.
### • Many financial reporters worry about the loss of U.S. economic
### strength vis-à-vis our principal trading partners.
### Vis-à-vis comes from Latin by way of French, where it means literally
### “face-to-face.” In English it was first used to mean a little horse-
### drawn carriage in which two people sat opposite each other. From
### there it acquired various other meanings, such as “dancing partner.”
### Today it no longer refers to actual physical faces and bodies, but its
### modern meaning comes from the fact that things that are face-to-
### face can easily be compared or contrasted. So, for example, a
### greyhound is very tall vis-à-vis a Scottie, and the Red Sox have often
### fared badly vis-à-vis the Yankees.

### visionary
### (1) A person with foresight and
### imagination. (2) A dreamer whose ideas are often impractical.
### • His followers regarded him as an inspired visionary; his opponents
### saw him as either a con man or a lunatic.
### A visionary is someone with a strong vision of the future. Since such
### visions aren't always accurate, a visionary's ideas may either work
### brilliantly or fail miserably. Even so, visionary is usually a positive
### word. Martin Luther King, Jr., for instance, was a visionary in his
### hopes and ideas for a just society. The word is also an adjective;
### thus, for example, we may speak of a visionary project, a visionary
### leader, a visionary painter, or a visionary company.

### envisage
### To have a mental picture of; visualize.
### • A mere three weeks after they had started dating, the two were
### already arguing, and none of us could envisage the relationship
### lasting for long.
### One of the imagination's most valuable uses is its ability to see
### something in the “mind's eye”—that is, to visualize, envision, or
### envisage something. Envisaging a possibility may be one of the chief
### abilities that separate human beings from the other animals. What
### we envisage may be physical (such as a completed piece of
### furniture) or nonphysical (such as finishing college). Envisaging life
### with a puppy might lead us down to the pound to buy one, and
### envisaging the sinking of an island nation may focus our minds on
### climate change.

### SPECT
### comes from the Latin verb specere, meaning “to look at,”
### and produces several familiar English words. Spectacles can be
### glasses that you look through; but a spectacle can also be a
### remarkable sight—in Roman times, perhaps a spectacular chariot
### race or a spectacularly bloody battle between gladiators and wild
### beasts, mounted for the pleasure of its spectators.

### aspect
### (1) A part of something. (2) A certain way in
### which something appears or may be regarded.
### • Many experts believe the mental aspect of distance racing is more
### important than the physical aspect.
### Since aspectus in Latin means “looked at,” an aspect of something is
### basically the direction from which it's looked at. So we may say that
### travel is your favorite aspect of your job, or that eating well is one
### aspect of a healthy life. If you look at a stage set from the front, it
### looks completely different than from behind, where all the
### mechanisms are visible, and both aspects are important. The word
### can be very useful when you're analyzing something, and it's used a
### great deal in the writings of scholars.

### prospect
### (1) The possibility that something will
### happen in the future. (2) An opportunity for something to happen.
### • There was little prospect of a breakthrough in the negotiations
### before the elections.
### Since the Latin prefix pro- often means “forward” (see
### PRO
### ),
### prospect refers to looking forward. The prospect of a recession may
### lead investors to pull their money out of the stock market. Graduates
### of a good law school usually have excellent prospects for finding
### employment. Prospective students roam campuses with their parents
### in the year before they plan to enter college.

### perspective
### (1) Point of view; the angle, direction,
### or standpoint from which a person looks at something. (2) The art or
### technique of painting or drawing a scene so that objects in it seem
### to have depth and distance.
### • From the perspective of the lowly soldier, the war looked very
### different.
### To the modern mind, it's hard to believe that perspective had to be
### “discovered,” but before the 1400s paintings simply lacked accurate
### perspective. Instead, important people and objects were simply
### shown larger than less important ones; and although distant objects
### were sometimes shown smaller than near ones, this wasn't done in a
### regular and accurate way. Just as odd, many paintings didn't
### represent the other meaning of perspective either—that is, a scene
### might not be shown as if it were being seen from one single place.
### Today, perspective is used much like standpoint. Just as standpoint
### once used to mean simply the physical place where you stand but
### today also means the way you “see” things as a result of who you
### are and what you do, the same could be said about perspective.

### prospectus
### A printed statement that describes
### something (such as a new business or a stock offering) and is sent
### out to people who may be interested in buying or investing.
### • The prospectus for the mutual fund says nothing about how its
### profit forecasts were calculated.
### Like prospect, prospectus looks forward. Thus, a prospectus
### originally outlined something that didn't yet exist, describing what it
### would become. This might even be a book; the great dictionary of
### Noah Webster, like that of Samuel Johnson, was first announced in
### the form of a prospectus, so that well-to-do people might actually
### subscribe to it—that is, pay for it in advance so that Webster would
### have money to live on while writing it. Soon, prospectus was being
### used to mean a description of a private school or college, intended
### to attract new students. Today the word very often means a
### description of a stock offering or mutual fund, whether new or not.

### VOC
### comes from the Latin words meaning “voice” and “speak.” So a
### vocal ensemble is a singing group. A vocation was originally a
### “calling” from God to do religious work as a priest, monk, or nun,
### though today most people use the word just to mean a career. And a
### vocabulary is a set of words for speaking.

### equivocate
### (1) To use ambiguous language,
### especially in order to deceive. (2) To avoid giving a direct answer.
### • As the company directors continued to equivocate, the union
### prepared to return to the picket lines.
### With its root equi-, meaning “equal,” equivocate suggests speaking
### on both sides of an issue at the same time. An equivocal answer is
### one that manages not to take a stand; an unequivocal answer, by
### contrast, is strong and clear. Politicians are famous for equivocating,
### but equivocation is also typical of used-car salesmen, nervous
### witnesses in a courtroom, and guys whose girlfriends ask them how
### committed they are to a relationship.

### irrevocable
### Impossible to call back or retract.
### • She had told him she wasn't going to see him again, but he
### couldn't believe her decision was irrevocable.
### Irrevocable has a formal sound to it and is often used in legal
### contexts. Irrevocable trusts are trust funds that cannot be dissolved
### by the people who created them (the other kind is a revocable
### trust). An irrevocable credit is an absolute obligation from a bank to
### provide credit to a customer. Irrevocable gifts, under U.S. tax law,
### are gifts that are given by one living person to another and can't be
### reclaimed by the giver. But the word isn't always legal; we've all had
### to make irrevocable decisions, decisions that commit us absolutely to
### something.

### advocate
### To speak in favor of.
### • Our lawyer is advocating a suit against the state, but most of us
### would rather try some other approaches first.
### The verb advocate may be followed by for (“advocated for better
### roads,” “advocated for merging the two school districts”) or by a
### noun or gerund (“advocating an increase in the military budget,”
### “advocated closing the budget gap”). But advocate isn't only a verb:
### An advocate is someone who advocates for you, or argues on your
### side. Originally, this was often a lawyer in court, and in Britain
### advocate is still a term for “lawyer.”

### vociferous
### Making noisy or emphatic outcries.
### • Whenever the referee at these soccer games makes a questionable
### call, you hear vociferous protests from half the parents.
### A vociferous group shouts loudly and insistently, and they're usually
### not too happy about something. So, for example, we often hear
### about vociferous critics, vociferous demands, vociferous opponents,
### or a vociferous minority. When a small group makes itself vociferous
### enough, everyone else may even start thinking it's actually a
### majority.

### PHON
### is a Greek root meaning “sound,” “voice,” or “speech.” It's
### probably most familiar in the form of the English suffix -phone, in
### words that begin with a Greek or Latin root as well. Thus, the tele-
### in telephone means “far,” the micro- in microphone means “small,”
### the xylo- in xylophone means “wood,” and so on.

### phonics
### A method of teaching beginners to read and
### pronounce words by learning the characteristic sounds of letters,
### letter groups, and especially syllables.
### • My son's school switched to phonics instruction several years ago,
### and reading achievement in the early grades has been improving.
### In the field of beginning reading, there are two basic schools of
### thought in the U.S. today. One emphasizes “whole language”
### teaching, which relies on teaching a lot of reading; the other
### emphasizes phonics, teaching how letters and syllables correspond
### to sounds. Phonics instruction may be especially difficult in English,
### since English has the most difficult spelling of any Western language.
### Consider the various ways we create the f sound in cough, photo,
### and giraffe, or the sh sound in special, issue, vicious, and portion, or
### the k sound in tack, quite, and shellac, and how we pronounce the o
### in do, core, lock, and bone, or the ea in lead, ocean, idea, and early.
### Teaching phonics obviously isn't an easy job, but it's probably an
### important one.

### phonetic
### Relating to or representing the sounds of the
### spoken language.
### • In almost every Spanish word the pronunciation is clear from the
### spelling, so the phonetic part of learning Spanish isn't usually a big
### challenge.
### The English alphabet is phonetic—that is, the letters represent
### sounds. The Chinese alphabet, however, isn't phonetic, since its
### symbols represent ideas rather than sounds. But even in English, a
### letter doesn't always represent the same sound; the “a” in cat,
### father, and mate, for example, represents three different sounds.
### Because of this, books about words often use specially created
### phonetic alphabets in which each symbol stands for a single sound
### in order to represent pronunciations. So in this book, cat, father, and
### mate would be phonetically represented as
### ,
### , and
### .

### polyphonic
### Referring to a style of music in which
### two or more melodies are sung or played against each other in
### harmony.
### • Whenever he needed something calming, he would put on some
### quiet polyphonic music from the Renaissance and just let the voices
### waft over him.
### Since poly- means “many” (see
### POLY
### ), polyphonic music has “many
### voices.” In polyphony, each part has its own melody, and they weave
### together in a web that may become very dense; a famous piece by
### Thomas Tallis, composed around 1570, has 40 separate voice parts.
### Polyphony reached its height during the 16th century with Italian
### madrigals and the sacred music of such composers as Tallis,
### Palestrina, and Byrd. Usually when we speak of polyphony we're
### talking about music of Bach's time and earlier; but the principles
### remain the same today, and songwriters such as the Beatles have
### sometimes used polyphony as well.

### cacophony
### Harsh or unpleasant sound.
### • In New York she was often dragged off by her boyfriend to
### downtown jazz concerts, where she struggled to make sense of what
### sounded like nothing but cacophony.
### Cacophony employs the Greek prefix caco-, meaning “bad,” but not
### everything we call cacophonous is necessarily bad. Grunge, thrash,
### hardcore, and goth music are unlistenable to some people and very
### popular to others. Open-air food markets may be marked by a
### cacophony of voices but also by wonderful sights and sounds. On
### the other hand, few people can really enjoy, for more than a few
### minutes, the cacophony of jackhammers, car horns, and truck
### engines that assaults the city pedestrian on a hot day in August.

### Answers

### CUR
### , from the Latin verb curare, means basically “care for.” Our
### verb cure comes from this root, as do manicure (“care of the
### hands”) and pedicure (“care of the feet”).

### curative
### Having to do with curing diseases.
### • As soon as the antibiotic entered his system, he imagined he could
### begin to feel its curative effects.
### Medical researchers are finding curative substances in places that
### surprise them. Folklore has led to some “new” cures of old diseases,
### and natural substances never before tried have often proved
### effective. Quinine, which comes from a tree in the Andes, was the
### original drug for malaria; aspirin's main ingredient came from willow
### bark; and Taxol, a drug used in treating several cancers, was
### originally extracted from the bark of a yew tree. The curative
### properties of these natural drugs are today duplicated in the
### laboratory.

### curator
### Someone in charge of something where things
### are on exhibit, such as a collection, a museum, or a zoo.
### • In recent decades, zoo curators have tried to make the animals'
### surroundings more and more like their natural homes.
### In a good-sized art museum, each curator is generally responsible
### for a single department or collection: European painting, Asian
### sculpture, Native American art, and so on. Curatorial duties include
### acquiring new artworks, caring for and repairing objects already
### owned, discovering frauds and counterfeits, lending artworks to
### other museums, and mounting exhibitions of everything from Greek
### sculpture to 20th-century clothing.

### procure
### To get possession of; obtain.
### • Investigators were looking into the question of how the governor
### had procured such a huge loan at such a favorable rate.
### While procure has the general meaning of “obtain,” it usually implies
### that some effort is required. It may also suggest getting something
### through a formal set of procedures. In many business offices, a
### particular person is responsible for procuring supplies, and
### government agencies have formal procurement policies. When
### teenagers use an older friend to procure the wrong kind of supplies
### for their parties, they often risk getting into trouble.

### sinecure
### A job or position requiring little work but
### usually providing some income.
### • The job of Dean of Students at any college is no sinecure; the
### hours can be long and the work draining.
### Sinecure contains the Latin word sine, “without,” and thus means
### “without care.” In some countries, the government in power may be
### free to award sinecure positions to their valued supporters; in other
### countries, this would be regarded as corruption. The positions
### occupied by British royalty are called sinecures by some people, who
### claim they enjoy their enormous wealth in return for nothing at all.
### But their many supporters point to the amount of public-service,
### charitable, and ceremonial work they perform, not to mention the
### effort they put into promoting Britain to the world.

### PERI
### , in both Latin and Greek, means “around.” A period is often a
### span of time that keeps coming around regularly, day after day or
### year after year. With a periscope, you can see around corners.
### Peristalsis is the process that moves food around the intestines;
### without it, digestion would grind to a halt.

### perimeter
### The boundary or distance around a body
### or figure.
### • In a medieval siege, an army would surround the perimeter of a
### city's high walls, denying the population any food from outside as it
### assaulted the walls with catapults and battering rams.
### The perimeter of a prison is ringed with high walls and watchtowers,
### and the entire perimeter of Australia is bounded by water. In
### geometry, you may be asked to calculate the perimeter of various
### geometrical shapes. In basketball, the perimeter is the area beyond
### the free-throw circle; a “perimeter player” tends to stay outside that
### circle. Try not to confuse this word with parameter, which usually
### means a rule or limit that controls what something is or how it can
### be done.

### periodontal
### Concerning or affecting the tissues
### around the teeth.
### • Years of bad living had filled his teeth with cavities, but it was
### periodontal disease that finished them off.
### In dentistry, cavities are important but they aren't the whole story;
### what happens to your gums is every bit as vital to your dental
### health. When you don't floss regularly to keep plaque from forming
### on your teeth and gums, the gums will slowly deteriorate. Dentists
### called periodontists specialize in the treatment of periodontal
### problems, and when the gums have broken down to the point where
### they can't hold the teeth in place a periodontist may need to provide
### dental implants, a costly and unpleasant process. But even a
### periodontist can't keep your gums healthy; that job is up to you.

### peripatetic
### (1) Having to do with walking. (2)
### Moving or traveling from place to place.
### • She spent her early adult years as a peripatetic musician, traveling
### from one engagement to another.
### The philosopher Aristotle had his school at the Lyceum gymnasium
### in Athens. The Lyceum may have resembled the Parthenon in being
### surrounded by a row of columns, or colonnade, which the Greeks
### would have called a peripatoi. Aristotle was also said to have paced
### slowly while teaching, and the Greek word for “pacing” was
### peripatos. And finally, peripatos meant simply “discussion.” Whatever
### the source of the word, Aristotle and his followers became known as
### the Peripatetics, and the “pacing” sense led to peripatetic's English
### meaning of traveling or moving about. Johnny Appleseed is a good
### example of a peripatetic soul, and peripatetic executives and
### salespeople today stare into their laptop computers while endlessly
### flying from city to city.

### peripheral
### (1) Having to do with the outer edges,
### especially of the field of vision. (2) Secondary or supplemental.
### • Like most good fourth-grade teachers, he had excellent peripheral
### vision, and the kids were convinced that he had eyes in the back of
### his head.
### Your peripheral vision is the outer area of your field of vision, where
### you can still detect movement and shapes. It can be very valuable
### when, for instance, you're driving into Chicago at rush hour,
### especially when switching lanes. When people call an issue in a
### discussion peripheral, they mean that it's not of primary importance,
### and they're probably suggesting that everyone get back to the main
### topic. Peripheral is now also a noun: computer peripherals are the
### added components—printers, webcams, microphones, etc.—that
### increase a computer's capacities.

### SENS
### comes from the Latin noun sensus, meaning “feeling” or
### “sense.” Sense itself obviously comes straight from the Latin. A
### sensation is something you sense. And if you're sensitive, you feel or
### sense things sharply, maybe even too sharply.

### sensor
### A device that detects a physical quantity (such as
### a movement or a beam of light) and responds by transmitting a
### signal.
### • The outdoor lights are triggered by a motion sensor that detects
### changes in infrared energy given off by moving human bodies.
### Sensors are used today almost everywhere. Radar guns bounce
### microwaves off moving cars. A burglar alarm may use a photosensor
### to detect when a beam of light has been broken, or may use
### ultrasonic sound waves that bounce off moving objects. Still other
### sensors
### may
### detect
### pressure
### (barometers)
### or
### chemicals
### (Breathalyzers and smoke detectors). Stud finders, used by
### carpenters to locate wooden studs under a wall, may employ
### magnets or radar. Wired gloves, which relay information about the
### position of the fingers, are used in virtual-reality environments. A
### cheap car alarm may be nothing but a shock sensor, in which a
### strong vibration will cause two metal surfaces to come together.

### desensitize
### To cause (someone or something) to
### react less to or be less affected by something.
### • Even squeamish nursing students report becoming desensitized to
### the sight of blood after a few months of training.
### Physical desensitizing is something that biologists have long been
### aware of. Basic training in the armed forces tries to desensitize new
### recruits to pain. We can desensitize ourselves to the summer heat by
### turning off the air conditioning, or become desensitized to the cold
### by walking barefoot in the snow. But desensitize is more often used
### when talking about negative emotions. Parents worry that their
### children will be desensitized to violence by playing video games.
### Soldiers may become desensitized to death on the battlefield.
### Desensitizing
### may
### be
### natural
### and
### desirable
### under
### some
### circumstances, but maybe not so good in others.

### extrasensory
### Not acting or occurring through
### any of the known senses.
### • A kind of extrasensory capacity seems to tell some soldiers when
### danger is near.
### Since extra means “outside, beyond” (see
### EXTRA
### ), extrasensory
### means basically “beyond the senses.” Extrasensory perception, or
### ESP, usually includes communication between minds involving no
### obvious contact (telepathy), gaining information about something
### without using the normal senses (clairvoyance), or predicting the
### future (precognition). According to polls, about 40% of Americans
### believe in ESP, and many of them have had personal experiences
### that seem to prove its existence. When someone jumps into your
### mind months or years after you had last thought of him or her, and
### the next day you learn that the person has just died, it can be hard
### to convince yourself it was just coincidence. Still, scientific attempts
### to prove the existence of ESP have never been terribly successful.

### sensuous
### (1) Highly pleasing to the senses. (2)
### Relating to the senses.
### • Part of what audiences loved about her was the delight she took in
### the sensuous pleasures of well-prepared food.
### Sensuous and sensual are close in meaning but not identical, and
### sensuous was actually coined by the poet John Milton so that he
### wouldn't have to use sensual. Sensuous usually implies pleasing of
### the senses by art or similar means; great music, for example, can be
### a source of sensuous delight. Sensual, on the other hand, usually
### describes gratification of the senses or physical appetites as an end
### in itself; thus we often think (perhaps unfairly) of wealthy Romans
### leading lives devoted to sensual pleasure. You can see why the
### Puritan Milton might have wanted another word.

### SOPH
### come from the Greek words meaning “wise” and “wisdom.” In
### English the root sometimes appears in words where the wisdom is of
### the “wise guy” variety, but in words such as philosophy we see it
### used more respectfully.

### sophistry
### Cleverly deceptive reasoning or argument.
### • For lawyers and politicians, the practice of sophistry from time to
### time is almost unavoidable.
### The Sophists were a group of Greek teachers of rhetoric and
### philosophy, famous during the 5th century B.C., who moved from
### town to town offering their teaching for a fee. The Sophists originally
### represented a respectable school of philosophy, but some critics
### claimed that they tried to persuade by means of clever but
### misleading arguments. The philosopher Plato wrote negatively about
### them, and the comic dramatist Aristophanes made fun of them,
### showing them making ridiculously fine distinctions about word
### meanings. We get our modern meanings of sophist, sophistry, and
### the adjective sophistical mostly from the opinions of these two men.

### sophisticated
### (1) Having a thorough knowledge
### of the ways of society. (2) Highly complex or developed.
### • In Woman of the Year, Katharine Hepburn plays a sophisticated
### journalist who can handle everything except Spencer Tracy.
### A sophisticated argument is thorough and well-worked-out. A
### satellite is a sophisticated piece of technology, complex and designed
### to accomplish difficult tasks. A sophisticated person, such as
### Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca, knows how to get around in the
### world. But sophistication isn't always admired. As you might guess,
### the word is closely related to sophistry (see above), and its original
### meanings weren't very positive, and still today many of us aren't
### sure we really like sophisticates.

### sophomoric
### Overly impressed with one's own
### knowledge, but in fact undereducated and immature.
### • We can't even listen to those sophomoric songs of his, with their
### attempts at profound wisdom that just demonstrate how little he
### knows about life.
### Sophomoric seems to include the roots soph-, “wise,” and moros,
### “fool” (seen in words such as moron), so the contrast between
### wisdom and ignorance is built right into the word. Cambridge
### University introduced the term sophomore for its second-year
### students in the 17th century (though it's no longer used in Britain),
### maybe to suggest that a sophomore has delusions of wisdom since
### he's no longer an ignorant freshman. In America today, sophomore
### is ambiguous since it can refer to either high school or college. But
### sophomoric should properly describe something—wit, behavior,
### arguments, etc.—that is at least trying to be sophisticated.

### theosophy
### A set of teachings about God and the
### world based on mystical insight, especially teachings founded on a
### blend of Buddhist and Hindu beliefs.
### • He had experimented with a number of faiths, starting with
### Buddhism and ending with a mixture of Eastern and Western
### thought that could best be called theosophy.
### The word theosophy, combining roots meaning “God” and “wisdom,”
### appeared back in the 17th century, but the well-known religious
### movement by that name, under the leadership of the Russian Helena
### Blavatsky, appeared only around 1875. Blavatsky's theosophy
### combined elements of Plato's philosophy with Christian, Buddhist,
### and Hindu thought (including reincarnation), in a way that she
### claimed had been divinely revealed to her. The Theosophical Society,
### founded in 1875 to promote her beliefs, still exists, as does the
### Anthroposophical Society, founded by her follower Rudolf Steiner.

## Words from Mythology and History
### Achilles' heel
### A vulnerable point.
### • By now his rival for the Senate seat had discovered his Achilles'
### heel, the court records of the terrible divorce he had gone through
### ten years earlier.
### When the hero Achilles was an infant, his sea-nymph mother dipped
### him into the river Styx to make him immortal. But since she held him
### by one heel, this spot did not touch the water and so remained
### mortal and vulnerable, and it was here that Achilles was eventually
### mortally wounded. Today, the tendon that stretches up the calf from
### the heel is called the Achilles tendon. But the term Achilles' heel isn't
### used in medicine; instead, it's only used with the general meaning
### “weak point”—for instance, to refer to a section of a country's
### borders that aren't militarily protected, or to a Jeopardy contestant's
### ignorance in the Sports category.

### arcadia
### A region or setting of rural pleasure and
### peacefulness.
### • The Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania are a vacationer's arcadia.
### Arcadia, a beautiful rural area in Greece, became the favorite setting
### for poems about ideal innocence unaffected by the passions of the
### larger world, beginning with the works of the Roman poet Virgil.
### There, shepherds play their pipes and sigh with longing for flirtatious
### nymphs; shepherdesses sing to their flocks; and goat-footed nature
### gods play in the fields and woods. Today, city dwellers who hope to
### retire to a country house often indulge in arcadian fantasies about
### what rural life will be like.

### Cassandra
### A person who predicts misfortune or
### disaster.
### • They used to call him a Cassandra because he often expected the
### worst, but his predictions tended to come true.
### Cassandra, the daughter of King Priam of Troy, was one of those
### beautiful young maidens with whom Apollo fell in love. He gave her
### the gift of prophecy in return for the promise of her sexual favors,
### but at the last minute she refused him. Though he could not take
### back his gift, he angrily pronounced that no one would ever believe
### her predictions; so when she prophesied the fall of her city to the
### Greeks and the death of its heroes, she was laughed at by the
### Trojans. A modern-day Cassandra goes around predicting gloom and
### doom—and may turn out to be right some of the time.

### cyclopean
### Huge or massive.
### • They're imagining a new medical center on a cyclopean scale—a
### vast ten-block campus with thirty high-rise buildings.
### The Cyclopes of Greek mythology were huge, crude giants, each
### with a single eye in the middle of his forehead. Odysseus and his
### men had a terrible encounter with a Cyclops, and escaped utter
### disaster only by stabbing a burning stick into the monster's eye. The
### great stone walls at such ancient sites as Troy and Mycenae are
### called cyclopean because the stones are so massive and the
### construction (which uses no cement) is so expert that it was
### assumed that only a superhuman race such as the Cyclopes could
### have achieved such a feat.

### draconian
### Extremely severe or cruel.
### • The severe punishments carried out in Saudi Arabia, including
### flogging for drunkenness, hand amputation for robbery, and
### beheading for drug trafficking, strike most of the world as draconian.
### Draconian comes from the name of Draco, a leader of Athens in the
### 7th century B.C. who in 621 B.C. produced its first legal code. The
### punishments he prescribed were extraordinarily harsh; almost
### anyone who couldn't pay his debts became a slave, and even minor
### crimes were punishable by death. So severe were these penalties
### that it was said that the code was written in blood. In the next
### century, the wise leader Solon would revise all of Draco's code,
### retaining the death penalty only for the crime of murder.

### myrmidon
### A loyal follower, especially one who
### executes orders unquestioningly.
### • To an American, these soldiers were like myrmidons, all too eager
### to do the Beloved Leader's bidding.
### In the Trojan War, the troops of the great hero Achilles were called
### Myrmidons. As bloodthirsty as wolves, they were the fiercest fighters
### in all Greece. They were said to have come from the island of
### Aegina, where, after the island's entire population had been killed by
### a plague, it was said to have been repopulated by Zeus, by turning
### all the ants in a great anthill into men. Because of their insect origin,
### the Myrmidons were blindly loyal to Achilles, so loyal that they would
### die without resisting if ordered to. The Trojans would not be the last
### fighting force to believe that a terrifying opposing army was made
### up of men who were not quite human.

### nemesis
### A powerful, frightening opponent or rival
### who is usually victorious.
### • During the 1970s and '80s, Japanese carmakers became the
### nemesis of the U.S. auto industry.
### The Greek goddess Nemesis doled out rewards for noble acts and
### vengeance for evil ones, but it's only her vengeance that anyone
### remembers. According to the Greeks, Nemesis did not always punish
### an offender right away, but might wait as much as five generations
### to avenge a crime. Regardless, her cause was always just and her
### eventual victory was sure. But today a nemesis doesn't always
### dispense justice; a powerful drug lord may be the nemesis of a
### Mexican police chief, for instance, just as Ernst Stavro Blofeld was
### James Bond's nemesis in three of Ian Fleming's novels.

### Trojan horse
### Someone or something that works
### from within to weaken or defeat.
### • Researchers are working on a kind of Trojan horse that will be
### welcomed into the diseased cells and then destroy them from within.
### After besieging the walls of Troy for ten years, the Greeks built a
### huge, hollow wooden horse, secretly filled it with armed warriors,
### and presented it to the Trojans as a gift for the goddess Athena, and
### the Trojans took the horse inside the city's walls. That night, the
### armed Greeks swarmed out and captured and burned the city. A
### Trojan horse is thus anything that looks innocent but, once
### accepted, has power to harm or destroy—for example, a computer
### program that seems helpful but ends up corrupting or demolishing
### the computer's software.
