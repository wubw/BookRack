### BIO
### comes from the Greek word for “life,” and forms the base for
### many English words. Biology, for instance, is the study of living
### forms and life processes; the biosphere is the entire area of and
### above the earth where life can exist; and biotechnology is the use of
### living organisms to create useful products.

### bionic
### Made stronger or more capable by electronic or
### mechanical devices.
### • Bionic feet and hands for amputees have ceased to be mere sci-fi
### fantasies and are becoming realities.
### The science of bionics uses knowledge about how biological systems
### work to help solve engineering problems. The material Velcro, for
### example, was inspired by the way burrs behave when they stick to
### your clothes, and some computer chips are now wired in ways that
### imitate the “wiring” of the brain and nervous system. But in popular
### use, the adjective bionic almost always describes artificial limbs or
### other bodily parts that work as much like real ones as possible. A
### perfect bionic arm would move and function as easily as a real arm—
### a goal we're rapidly getting closer to.

### biopsy
### The removal and examination of tissue, cells, or
### fluids from a living body.
### • Everyone felt relieved when the results of the biopsy showed the
### tumor wasn't cancerous.
### Matter examined in a biopsy is always taken from a living organism.
### Most biopsies are done by using a needle to extract tissue or fluid,
### but some may instead require cutting, and others may amount to
### nothing more than swabbing the inside of the patient's cheek.
### Biopsies are best known as a means of detecting cancer, but a
### doctor may also take a biopsy of heart muscle to investigate
### suspected heart disease, for example, or perform a biopsy on a
### pregnant woman to test for disorders in the fetus.

### biodegradable
### Able to be broken down into
### harmless substances by microorganisms or other living things.
### • Though the advertisements promised that the entire package was
### biodegradable, environmentalists expressed their doubts.
### In biodegradable, with its root grad, “to step or move,” and its prefix
### de- “downward,” we get an adjective describing things that can be
### broken down into basic substances through normal environmental
### processes. Animal and plant products are normally biodegradable,
### but mineral substances such as metals, glass, and plastics usually
### are not. Newly developed biodegradable plastics are now appearing
### in numerous products. However, “biodegradable” products can vary
### greatly in how long they take to break down. A loaf of bread may
### require only a couple of weeks, and a piece of paper may vanish in a
### couple of months, but some “biodegradable” plastic milk cartons
### may take four or five years.

### symbiosis
### (1) The close living together of two
### different forms of life in a way that benefits both. (2) A cooperative
### relationship between two people or groups.
### • The lichen that grows on rocks is produced by the symbiosis of a
### fungus and an alga, two very different organisms.
### With its prefix sym-, “with,” symbiosis expresses the notion of
### cooperation between living things. Symbiotic associations are found
### throughout the plant and animal world. You may have read, for
### instance, of the little blackbird plover, which picks the teeth of the
### fierce African crocodile. Or the bird called the African honeyguide,
### which leads a little mammal called the ratel to a bees' nest, which
### the ratel, protected from the bees by its thick fur, then breaks open,
### and both it and the honeyguide feast on the honey. Or even our own
### bodies, which are home to millions of bacteria—especially the
### bacterium E. coli in our intestines—and neither we nor E. coli could
### live without the other. You can probably think of plenty of human
### relationships that could be called symbiotic as well.

### GEN
### , which comes from the Greek genos, meaning “birth,” has
### generated dozens of English words. A set of genes, for instance,
### gives birth to a living being. And a genealogy is a historical map of
### your family, showing how each generation gave birth to the next.

### genesis
### Origin, beginning.
### • The genesis of the project dates back to 1976, when the two
### young men were roommates at Cornell University.
### The traditional Greek name for the first and best-known book of the
### Bible is Genesis, meaning “origin.” Genesis tells the stories of the
### creation, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's ark, the Tower of
### Babel, Abraham and his sons, and more—the stories that explain
### how the world and humanity were created, as well as much about
### how humanity, and especially the descendants of Abraham, relate to
### the rest of the world. Today we use genesis to refer to the creative
### beginnings of much smaller things, but never unimportant ones.

### generator
### A machine by which mechanical energy is
### changed into electrical energy
### • The jungle settlement depended on a large generator, which
### provided electricity for a couple of hours each morning and evening.
### Generators work by rotating a coil of wire in a magnetic field,
### causing a current to flow in the wire. A generator may be a huge
### spinning turbine powered by water, wind, steam, gas, or nuclear
### reactions, which sends electricity out through power lines to
### thousands of customers. But normally when we use the word, we're
### thinking of a small machine powered by gasoline or diesel, such as
### you might keep in your basement for those times when a storm
### knocks out your power, to create electricity right in front of your
### eyes. A special kind of generator called an alternator powers a car's
### electrical system (including its lights, power steering, etc.) while the
### car is running.

### genre
### Kind, sort; especially a distinctive type or category
### of literature, art, or music.
### • Opera was a new genre for her, since all her compositions up until
### then had been songs and chamber music.
### Genre, as you might guess from the way it sounds, comes straight
### from French, a language based on Latin. It's closely related to
### genus, a word you may have encountered in biology class. Both
### words contain the gen- root because they indicate that everything in
### a particular category (a genre or a genus) belongs to the same
### “family” and thus has the same origins. So the main genres of
### classical music would include symphonies, sonatas, and opera, and
### the major genres of literature would include novels, short stories,
### poetry, and drama. But within the category of novels, we could also
### say that detective novels, sci-fi novels, romance novels, and young-
### adult novels are separate genres.

### carcinogenic
### Producing or causing cancer.
### • Although she knows all too well that the tobacco in cigarettes is
### carcinogenic, she's too addicted to quit.
### It sometimes seems as if the list of carcinogenic substances gets
### longer every day. A substance such as a food additive that's been in
### common use for years may unexpectedly show signs of being
### carcinogenic in laboratory experiments. When that happens, the
### suspected carcinogen will often have to be withdrawn from the
### market. When a building material like asbestos turns out to be a
### carcinogen, it may also have to be physically removed from
### buildings. English has hundreds of other scientific words ending in -
### genic (such as allergenic), and in almost all of them the ending
### means “causing.”

### FUNCT
### comes from the Latin verb fungi, “to perform, carry out.” If
### your car is functional, it's able to perform its function of providing
### transportation. But a functional illiterate is a person who, for all
### practical or functional purposes, might as well not be able to read or
### write at all.

### functionary
### (1) Someone who performs a
### certain function. (2) Someone who holds a position in a political
### party or government.
### • He was one of a group of party functionaries assigned to do the
### dirty work of the campaign.
### For most of us, being described as a functionary wouldn't be a
### compliment. The word refers especially to a person of lower rank,
### with little or no authority, who must carry out someone else's orders.
### Bureaucrat is often a synonym. However, functionary can also refer
### to the world beyond government and offices; a character in a play,
### for example, could be called a functionary if it was obvious that her
### sole function was to keep the plot moving.

### malfunction
### To fail to operate in the normal or
### usual manner.
### • An examination of the wreck revealed that the brakes may have
### malfunctioned as the truck started down the hill.
### A malfunctioning switch might keep us from turning on a light. A
### malfunctioning heart valve might require replacement with an
### artificial valve, and if your immune system malfunctions it may start
### to attack healthy cells. And a malfunction in a voting machine could
### result in hundreds of votes being miscounted.

### defunct
### No longer, living, existing, or functioning.
### • The company, which had once had annual sales of $150 million,
### was now defunct.
### If you know that de- often means “the opposite of” (see
### DE
### ), it's
### easy to guess the meaning of defunct. Shakespeare seems to have
### been the first writer to use this adjective, in Henry V. Defunct
### American political parties include the Greenback Party, the
### Readjuster Party, and the Nullifier Party. Defunct Academy Awards
### categories include Best Dance Direction and Best Assistant Director.
### Defunct U.S. auto models include the Dudly Bug, the LuLu, the
### Hupmobile, the Gas-au-lec, and the Nu-Klea Starlite. But to speak of
### a person as defunct would sound disrespectful—which is how it
### sounds in e. e. cummings's famous poem “Buffalo Bill's defunct.”

### dysfunctional
### (1) Showing abnormal or
### unhealthy behaviors and attitudes within a group of people. (2)
### Being unable to function in a normal way.
### • A psychologist would call their family dysfunctional, but even
### though there's a lot of yelling and slamming of doors, they seem
### pretty happy to me.
### Dysfunctional and dysfunction have been used for almost a hundred
### years, often in medical writing (“brain dysfunction,” “a dysfunctional
### liver”) but also by social scientists (“a dysfunctional city council,”
### “diplomatic dysfunction”). But they only really entered the general
### vocabulary in the 1980s, when therapists and talk-show hosts began
### talking about dysfunctional families. The signs of family dysfunction
### turned out to be numerous, and it soon began to seem as if pretty
### much all our families could be called dysfunctional.

### MUT
### comes from the Latin mutare, “to change.” Plenty of science-
### fiction movies—Godzilla, The Fly, The Incredible Shrinking Man—
### used to be made on the subject of weird mutations, changes in
### normal people or animals that usually end up causing death and
### destruction. What causes the unfortunate victim to mutate may be a
### mysterious or alien force, or perhaps invisible radiation. Though the
### science in these films isn't always right on target, the scare factor of
### an army of mutants can be hard to beat.

### commute
### (1) To exchange or substitute; especially to
### change a penalty to another one that is less severe. (2) To travel
### back and forth regularly.
### • There was a public outcry at the harshness of the prison sentence,
### and two days later the governor commuted it to five years.
### When you commute between a suburb and a city, you're
### “exchanging” one location for another. When a chief executive
### substitutes a life sentence for the death sentence handed down by a
### court, he or she is commuting the original sentence. Most such
### commutations are the result of the prisoner's good behavior. A
### commutator is a device in many electric motors that regularly
### changes alternating current to direct current.

### immutable
### Not able or liable to change.
### • Early philosophers believed there was an immutable substance at
### the root of all existence.
### Mutable means simply “changeable,” so when the negative prefix im-
### is added we get its opposite. In computer programming, an
### immutable object is one that can't be changed after it's been
### created. In a constantly changing world, people who hunger for
### things as immutable as the laws of nature may try to observe an
### immutable moral code and set of values. Unfortunately, immutability
### isn't a basic quality of many things in this world.

### permutation
### A change in the order of a set of
### objects; rearrangement, variation.
### • They had rearranged the rooms in the house plans four or five
### times already, but the architect had come up with yet another
### permutation.
### There are six permutations of the letters A, B, and C, selected two at
### a time: AB, AC, BC, BA, CA, and CB. As you see, order is important
### in permutations. (By contrast, there are only three combinations: AB,
### AC, and BC.) Permutation is an important concept in mathematics,
### especially in the field of probability. But we can use the word more
### generally to mean any change produced by rearranging existing
### parts without introducing new ones. Some soap operas, for example,
### love permutations; the cast of regulars is constantly being
### rearranged into new pairs, and even triangles.

### transmute
### (1) To change in shape, appearance, or
### nature, especially for the better; to transform. (2) To experience
### such a change.
### • Working alone in his cluttered laboratory in 15th-century Milan, he
### spent twenty years searching for a method of transmuting lead into
### gold.
### Transmutation changes something over into something else. Thus, a
### writer may transmute his life into stories or novels, and an arranger
### might transmute a lively march tune into a quiet lullaby. In the “Myth
### of Er” at the end of Plato's Republic, for example, human souls are
### transmuted into the body and existence of their choice. Having
### learned from their last life what they do not want to be, many
### choose transmutation into something that seems better. A meek man
### chooses to be transmuted into a tyrant, a farmer into a dashing (but
### short-lived) warrior, and so on. But very few seem to have learned
### anything from their former life that would make their choice a real
### improvement.

### FRACT
### comes from the Latin verb frangere, “to break or shatter.” A
### fraction is one of the pieces into which a whole can be broken, and a
### fracture is a break in a wall, a rock, or a bone.

### fractious
### (1) Apt to cause trouble or be unruly. (2)
### Stirring up quarrels; irritable.
### • Shopping with a fractious child is next to impossible.
### One of the earliest meanings of fraction was “a break in good
### feeling”—that is, an argument or conflict. So a person who starts
### fights could be called fractious. A fractious horse is one that hasn't
### been properly broken or trained. A fractious political party is one
### whose members keep fighting among themselves. And a fractious
### baby is one that's always breaking the home's peace and quiet with
### angry squalling.

### fractal
### An irregular shape that looks much the same at
### any scale on which it is examined.
### • He was showing her the fractals in the local ferns, in which each
### leaf reproduced the shape of the entire fern.
### This term was coined in 1975 to describe shapes that seem to exist
### at both the small-scale and large-scale levels in the same natural
### object. Fractals can be seen in snowflakes, in which the microscopic
### crystals that make up a flake look much like the flake itself. They can
### also be seen in tree bark and in broccoli buds. Coastlines often
### represent fractals as well, being highly uneven at both a large scale
### and a very small scale. Fractal geometry has been important in many
### fields, including astronomy, physical chemistry, and fluid mechanics.
### And even some artists are benefiting, creating beautiful and
### interesting abstract designs by means of fractals.

### infraction
### The breaking of a law or a violation of
### another's rights.
### • The assistant principal dealt with any students who had committed
### minor infractions of the rules.
### An infraction is usually the breaking of a law, rule, or agreement. So
### a nation charged with an infraction of an international treaty will
### usually have to pay a penalty. In Federal law, an infraction is even
### smaller than a misdemeanor, and the only penalty is a fine. Most of
### us occasionally commit infractions of parking laws and get ticketed;
### speeding tickets are usually for infractions as well, though they go
### on a permanent record and can end up costing you money for years
### to come. The closely related word infringement generally refers to a
### violation of a right or privilege; use of another's writings without
### permission, for example, may be an infringement of the copyright.

### refraction
### The change of direction of a ray of light or
### wave of energy as it passes at an angle from one substance into
### another in which its speed is different.
### • From where I was standing, the refraction made it look as if her
### legs underwater were half their actual length.
### The root of refraction is seen in the notion that the path of a ray of
### light or wave of energy is “broken” when it is deflected or turned.
### The effects of refraction can be seen in a rainbow, which is formed
### when light rays passing into (and reflecting out of) water droplets
### are bent at different angles depending on their color, so that the
### light separates into bands of color. The amount of refraction depends
### on the angle and the type of matter; refraction can occur even when
### passing through different kinds of air. A mirage, such as you might
### see in the desert or over a patch of asphalt in the summer, occurs
### when light passing through warm air meets the very hot air near the
### surface; reflecting the sky, it often resembles a lake.

### TELE
### has as its basic meanings “distant” or “at a distance.” A
### telescope is for looking at far-off objects; a camera's telephoto lens
### magnifies a distant scene for a photograph; and a television lets us
### watch things taking place far away.

### telegenic
### Well-suited to appear on television,
### especially by having an appearance and manner attractive to
### viewers.
### • The local anchorpeople all have telegenic faces and great hair,
### though they don't always seem to know a lot about the economy or
### political science.
### The word telegenic, a blend of “television” and “photogenic,” first
### appeared back in the 1930s, before hardly anyone owned a TV. With
### the supreme importance of TV cameras in politics, people running
### for political office today worry about being telegenic enough to have
### a successful career. Even events have been described as telegenic;
### unfortunately, such events are often human tragedies, such as fires,
### earthquakes, or floods, which happen to broadcast well and capture
### the interest of the viewers.

### teleological
### Showing or relating to design or
### purpose, especially in nature.
### • Many naturalists object to the teleological view that sees
### everything in nature as part of a grand design or plan.
### Teleology has the basic meaning “the study of ends or purposes.” So
### Aristotle's famous “teleological argument” claims that anything
### complex must have a creator, and thus that God exists. And a
### teleological explanation of evolutionary changes claims that all such
### changes occur for a definite purpose. But the type of morality called
### “teleological ethics” doesn't involve God at all: instead, it claims that
### we should judge whether an act is good or bad by seeing if it
### produces a good or bad result, even if the act involves harming or
### killing another person.

### telemetry
### The science or process of measuring such
### things as pressure, speed, or temperature, sending the result usually
### by radio to a distant station, and recording the measurements there.
### • The telemetry of the satellite had gone dead in 1999, and its fate
### remains a mystery.
### Telemetry is used to obtain data on the internal functioning of
### missiles, rockets, unmanned planes, satellites, and probes, providing
### data on such factors as position, altitude, and speed as well as
### conditions like temperature, air pressure, wind speed, and radiation.
### Weather forecasters rely on telemetry to map weather patterns.
### Astronauts on the space shuttle are monitored with telemetry that
### measures and transmits readings on their blood pressure,
### respiration, and heart rates. Similar kinds of telemetry are used by
### biologists to study animals in the wild and keep track of their
### populations and movements. Telemetry is also widely used in
### modern agriculture, often to regulate irrigation.

### telecommute
### To work at home using an electronic
### link with a central office.
### • A dozen of our employees are now telecommuting, and we
### calculate that altogether they're saving 25 gallons of gasoline and its
### pollution every day.
### This word has been around since the early 1970s, when computer
### terminals in the home first began to be connected to so-called
### mainframe computers by telephone lines. Since the creation of the
### World Wide Web in 1991, and with the widening access to
### broadband connections, telecommuting has grown to the point that
### the U.S. is now home to many millions of occasional telecommuters.
### Telecommuting can make work much easier for people with young
### children and people with disabilities, and because of its obvious
### environmental benefits and the lessening of traffic congestion,
### telecommuting is now officially encouraged by federal legislation.
### Still, only a fraction of those who could be telecommuting are
### actually doing so.

### Answers

### PHIL
### comes from the Greek word meaning “love.” In philosophy, it's
### joined with sophia, “wisdom,” so philosophy means literally “love of
### wisdom.” When joined with biblio-, “book,” the result is bibliophile, or
### “lover of books.” And Philadelphia, containing the Greek word
### adelphos, “brother,” was named by its Quaker founder, William Penn,
### as the city of “brotherly love.”

### oenophile
### A person with an appreciation and usually
### knowledge of fine wine.
### • As an amateur oenophile, he was constantly talking to his friends
### in the vocabulary of wine tasting.
### The root oeno- comes from the Greek word meaning “wine.” The
### oenophile should be distinguished from the oenologist, or “student
### of wine,” who has a technical knowledge of the cultivation of wine
### grapes and of the whole winemaking process. Oenophiles may not
### know how to make a great wine, but they know one when they taste
### it. Not only that, but they can describe it using nouns like nose,
### finish, and bouquet, as well as adjectives such as woody, full-bodied,
### robust, and noble.

### philatelist
### A person who collects or studies stamps.
### • The U.S. Postal Service issues first-day covers of each new stamp
### design especially for philatelists.
### The first postage stamps were made available on May 1, 1840, in
### England, and it didn't take long for the hobby of stamp collecting to
### arise. Within a year, a young London lady was letting it be known in
### a newspaper advertisement that she was “desirous of covering her
### dressing room with cancelled postage stamps.” Philately has been
### alive and well ever since, though modern philatelists—including rock
### stars, English kings, and American presidents—are more likely to put
### the stamps they collect in special albums.

### Anglophile
### A person who greatly admires or favors
### England and English things.
### • His grandparents were Anglophiles, and whenever they had guests
### in the afternoon the beautiful silver tea service would come out.
### Even after fighting two wars against Britain, Americans continued to
### regard England with more fondness than perhaps any other country.
### For much of our history, Americans have sought to imitate the British
### in any number of ways—American movie stars even used to adopt
### British accents—and the two countries have long been close allies.
### But Britain isn't the only country Americans fall in love with;
### Francophiles (France-lovers), Germanophiles (Germany-lovers), and
### Italophiles (Italy-lovers) are also common. In the 19th century,
### Russian Slavophiles called for rejecting European culture in favor of
### homegrown Russian culture (Slavs being those who speak a Slavic
### language such as Russian or Polish). Occasionally phil- words are
### turned around; thus, someone who is philosemitic is a lover of
### Jewish culture.

### philanthropy
### (1) A charitable act or gift. (2) An
### organization that distributes or is supported by charitable
### contributions.
### • Her last philanthropy was dedicated to protecting a vast area in
### central Africa where many of the great apes lived.
### With its anthro- root (see
### ANTHROP
### ), philanthropy means literally
### “love of mankind.” Thus, philanthropy is giving money for a purpose
### or cause benefiting people who you don't personally know. (Animals
### are usually included as well.) Individuals have often set up their own
### permanent philanthropic organizations in the form of foundations.
### The greatest American philanthropists have included Warren Buffett,
### Bill Gates, Andrew Carnegie, and John D. Rockefeller, but tens of
### millions of us could be considered philanthropists on a much smaller
### scale.

### NEG
### and its variants nec- and ne- are prefixes of denial or refusal in
### Latin, and the Latin verb negare means “to say no.” To negate
### something is to make it ineffective, and something negative denies,
### contradicts, refuses, or reverses.

### negligent
### (1) Failing to take proper or normal care. (2)
### Marked by or likely to show neglect.
### • The Army Corps of Engineers was found negligent for having failed
### to keep the New Orleans levees in good repair.
### To be negligent is to be neglectful. Negligence is an important legal
### concept; it's usually defined as the failure to use the care that a
### normally careful person would in a given situation. Negligence is a
### common claim in lawsuits regarding medical malpractice, auto
### accidents, and workplace injuries. But you can also be negligent
### about answering your e-mail, or negligent in the way you dress.
### (The original garment called a negligee was worn by women who
### had neglected to get fully dressed.) The legal meanings of negligent
### and negligence, however, tend to be the ones we most often
### encounter nowadays.

### abnegation
### Self-denial.
### • She's been denying herself pleasures since she was a child, so
### she's actually attracted by the life of abnegation that a nun leads.
### Abnegation plays an important part in the teachings of all the major
### religions. The founder of Buddhism was a prince who gave up all his
### worldly goods when he discovered the world of poverty that lay
### outside the palace gates, and abnegation has been a Buddhism
### practice ever since. Hinduism has an even older tradition of
### abnegation. Special periods of abnegation and fasting may even be
### included in a religion's yearly calendar; serious Christians give up
### some pleasure for the 40-day period of Lent, for instance, and
### Muslims are forbidden to eat during daylight hours during the month
### of Ramadan.

### negligible
### So small as to be neglected or
### disregarded.
### • Local weather forecasters had made it sound like the blizzard of
### the century, but the amount of snow turned out to be negligible.
### Negligible comes from the same Latin verb as neglect, so something
### negligible is literally “neglectable.” If an accident results in negligible
### damage to your car, you should be thankful. If two years of intense
### focus on testing in the classroom results in a negligible improvement
### in student test scores, it's probably time to try something new.

### renege
### To go back on a promise or commitment.
### • If his partners renege at this point, the whole project will probably
### fall through.
### To renege on a bet is to refuse to pay up when you lose. To renege
### on a promise of marriage, or on a deal of any kind, is to pull out.
### History is full of promises and commitments and treaties that were
### reneged on, such as the many treaties with Native Americans that
### American settlers and the U.S. government went back on over a
### period of almost 300 years. A synonym is welsh (“He always welshes
### on his deals”); however, since that word may have come from
### Welsh, meaning a native of Wales in Britain, some people think it
### might be offensive.

## Number Words
### DEC
### comes from both Greek and Latin and means “ten.” So a
### decade lasts for ten years; the decimal system is based on ten; and
### a decahedron is a geometrical shape with ten sides.

### decalogue
### (1) (capitalized) The Ten Commandments.
### (2) Any basic set of rules that must be obeyed.
### • At 15 she posted a decalogue of life rules on her bedroom door,
### starting with “1. Be respectful to teachers.”
### In decalogue the root deca- is combined with logos, Greek for
### “word.” In the Biblical book of Exodus, the original Decalogue, or Ten
### Commandments, was handed to Moses by God atop Mount Sinai. In
### Jewish and Christian tradition, the Ten Commandments are regarded
### as laws handed down from the highest authority and as the
### foundation of morality. They include commands to honor God, the
### Sabbath day, and one's parents, and bans on worshiping images,
### swearing, murder, adultery, theft, lying about others, and envying
### what others have. Individuals have often had their own personal
### decalogues; Thomas Jefferson's “ten commandments” started off
### with “Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.”

### decathlon
### An athletic contest made up of ten parts.
### • Though the U.S. has dominated the Olympic decathlon for its
### whole modern history, the 1948 victory by the 17-year-old Bob
### Mathias still astonished the world.
### Decathlon from deca- and athlon, “contest,” means “ten contests.”
### The ancient Greek Olympics held five-contest competitions, or
### pentathlons, that were based on the skills needed in battle. The
### modern Olympic decathlon, which was born in 1912, consists of the
### 100-meter run, 400-meter run, 1500-meter run, 110-meter high
### hurdles, javelin throw, discus throw, shot put, pole vault, high jump,
### and long jump. The original winner was the legendary Jim Thorpe,
### who would later be judged the greatest American athlete of the 20th
### century. And ever since, the Olympic decathlon winner has been
### called the finest all-around athlete in the world.

### decibel
### A unit based on a scale ranging from 0 to
### about 130 used to measure the loudness of sound, with 0 indicating
### the least sound that can be heard and 130 the average level that
### causes pain.
### • She worries about the damage that high decibel levels can cause,
### and always wears ear protection when mowing the lawn.
### The bel in decibel honors the inventor of the telephone, Alexander
### Graham Bell. Decibels work on a logarithmic scale (you may need to
### look up logarithm), so 20 decibels is 10 times as strong as 10
### decibels, and 50 decibels is 1,000 times as strong as 20 decibels.
### The decibel readings of some everyday sounds make for interesting
### comparisons. Whispers and rustling leaves usually register under 20
### decibels, the average level of conversation is about 50 decibels, and
### noisy factories or office machinery may have decibel levels of 90 to
### 100. In the category of sounds between 100 and 120 decibels,
### which can eventually cause deafness, we find elevated trains,
### artillery—and rock concerts.

### decimate
### To reduce drastically or destroy most of.
### • Before the developments of modern medicine, diphtheria and
### typhoid could decimate the populations of entire towns and cities.
### Commanders in the Roman army took discipline seriously. Mutiny in
### the ranks was dealt with by selecting, through drawing lots, one
### soldier in every ten and making the other nine club or stone the
### unfortunate winner of this gruesome lottery to death. The dec- in
### decimate thus reflects this Roman practice, which was ordered by
### such well-known leaders as Crassus, Mark Antony, and Augustus.
### But over time, the word's meaning has shifted, and today it almost
### always describes great destruction or loss of life. So, for example,
### we can say that a wave of layoffs has decimated a company's
### workforce, the populations of some of Africa's greatest wild animals
### have been decimated by poaching, or aerial bombardment has
### decimated whole sections of a city.

### CENT
### , from the Latin centum, means “one hundred.” A dollar is
### made up of a hundred cents, though other monetary systems use
### centavos or centimes as the smallest coin. A centipede has what
### appears to be a hundred feet, though the actual number varies
### greatly. But there really are a hundred years in a century.

### centenary
### A 100th anniversary or the celebration of
### it; a centennial.
### • The company is celebrating the centenary of its founding with a
### lavish banquet.
### A centenary, like its cousin centennial, is an anniversary. Thus, the
### year 2013 may mark the centenary of a town's founding, and the
### year-long calendar of public events that the town sponsors for the
### occasion—that is, the celebration of the anniversary—can also be
### called a centenary. Individuals have their own centenaries, which
### usually celebrate their births; thus, Gerald Ford's centenary will occur
### in 2013, and John Kennedy's in 2017. And if you live long enough to
### be a centenarian, you'll be around to join the celebrations.

### centigrade
### Relating to a temperature scale in which
### 0° is the freezing point of water and 100° is its boiling point.
### • The normal temperature of a human body is 37° centigrade.
### The centigrade scale is essentially identical to the Celsius scale, the
### standard scale by which temperature is measured in most of the
### world. Anders Celsius of Sweden first devised the centigrade scale in
### the early 18th century. But in his version, 100° marked the freezing
### point of water, and 0° its boiling point. Later users found it less
### confusing to reverse these two. To convert Fahrenheit degrees to
### centigrade, subtract 32 and multiply by 5/9. To convert centigrade to
### Fahrenheit, multiply by 9/5 and add 32.

### centimeter
### A length measuring 1/100th of a
### meter, or about 0.39 inch.
### • There are 2.54 centimeters in an inch, 30.48 centimeters in a foot.
### In the metric system, which is used in most countries of the world,
### each basic unit of measure of length, area, or volume can be divided
### into centimeters. A meter consists of 100 centimeters, a square
### meter consists of 10,000 square centimeters, and a cubic meter
### consists of 1,000,000 cubic centimeters.

### centurion
### The officer in command of a Roman
### century, originally a troop of 100 soldiers.
### • Centurions and their centuries were the backbone of the great
### Roman armies.
### In ancient Rome, a century was approximately equal to a company
### in the U.S. Army, and a centurion was roughly equivalent to a
### captain. Centurions play a role in the New Testament; Jesus
### performs a miracle for a centurion in Capernaum, centurions are
### present at the crucifixion, and in later years St. Paul is arrested by
### centurions. According to a writer of the time, centurions were
### chosen for their size and strength, their abilities at swordplay and at
### throwing missiles, and the quality of their discipline, which was
### partly shown by how well their soldiers kept their own armor
### polished.
