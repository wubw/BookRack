### SUB
### means “under.” So a subway runs under the streets, and a
### submarine moves under the ocean's surface. A subject is a person
### under the authority of another. A movie's subplot is lower in
### importance than the main plot. Subscribe once meant “to write one's
### name underneath,” so subscription was the act of signing a
### document or agreement.

### subconscious
### Existing in the mind just below the
### level of awareness.
### • After dropping three dishes in a week, she began thinking there
### might be some kind of subconscious agitation behind her case of
### butterfingers.
### We're rarely aware, or at least fully aware, of our subconscious
### mental activity. But subconscious thought does affect our feelings
### and behavior, and it's often revealed in dreams, artistic expression,
### and slips of the tongue. The subconscious mind can be a hiding
### place for anxiety, a source of creativity, and often the reason behind
### our own mysterious behavior.

### subjugate
### To bring under control and rule as a
### subject; conquer, subdue.
### • The country's government claimed it was just trying to protect
### national security, but some saw its actions as an attempt to
### subjugate the news media.
### Since jugus means “yoke” in Latin, subjugate means literally “bring
### under the yoke.” Farmers control oxen by means of a heavy wooden
### yoke over their shoulders. In ancient Rome, conquered soldiers,
### stripped of their uniforms, might actually be forced to pass under an
### ox yoke as a sign of submission to the Roman victors. Even without
### an actual yoke, what happens to a population that has come under
### the control of another can be every bit as humiliating. In dozens of
### countries throughout the world, ethnic minorities are denied basic
### rights and view themselves as subjugated by their country's
### government, army, and police.

### subliminal
### Not quite strong enough to be sensed
### or perceived consciously.
### • A few worried parents claimed that some heavy-metal songs
### contain subliminal messages—in the form of words recorded
### backwards—that urge young fans to take up devil worship.
### Since the Latin word limen means “threshold,” something subliminal
### exists just below the threshold of conscious awareness. The classic
### example of a subliminal message is “Eat popcorn” flashed on a
### movie screen so quickly that the audience doesn't even notice it
### consciously. Actually, no such advertising has ever been shown to
### work. But ordinary ads, both in print and on TV, do contain all kinds
### of images that shape our response to the product being advertised
### even when we don't realize it. Try looking carefully at some ads that
### you like, in order to discover how many ways they may be
### subliminally affecting you.

### subversion
### (1) An attempt to overthrow a
### government by working secretly from within. (2) The corrupting of
### someone or something by weakening their morals, loyalty, or faith.
### • It's sometimes easier for a government to combat attack from
### outside than subversion from within.
### Subversion is literally the “turning over” of something. In the 1950s
### and '60s, many people worried about communist subversion of the
### U.S. government, though they often saw subversive activities where
### none existed. Nondemocratic governments often claim that anyone
### who disagrees with them or joins a demonstration is a subversive.
### But subversion isn't always quite so serious a matter; when words
### like weekend, sandwich, job, and camping started being used by the
### French, for example, some of them began claiming that America was
### subverting their language.

### HYPER
### is a Greek prefix that means “above or beyond,” so hyper-
### often means about the same thing as super-. Hyperinflation is
### inflation that's growing at a very high rate. To be hypercritical or
### hypersensitive is to be critical or sensitive beyond the normal. And if
### you hyperextend a knee or elbow, it means you're actually bending it
### backward.

### hyperactive
### Excessively active.
### • Stephen King's hyperactive imagination has produced dozens of
### fantastical stories, not to mention countless nightmares in his
### readers.
### For doctors and psychologists, hyperactive describes a condition with
### unpleasant consequences. Hyperactive children usually have a very
### short attention span and can't sit still, and hyperactivity can lead to
### difficulty in learning or just get them in trouble for disturbing their
### classes. But not every high-spirited child is hyperactive. Having a
### high energy level is pretty normal for children, and some parents
### think that prescribing drugs for hyperactivity is mostly just good for
### the drug companies.

### hyperbole
### Extreme exaggeration.
### • The food at Chez Pierre was good, but it couldn't live up to the
### hyperbole of the restaurant critics.
### Advertisers and sports commentators make their living by their
### skillful use of hyperbole. Presenting each year's Superbowl as “the
### greatest contest in the history of sports” certainly qualifies as
### hyperbole, especially since the final scores are usually so lopsided.
### Equally hyperbolic are advertisers' claims that this year's new car
### model is “the revolutionary vehicle you've been waiting for” when it's
### barely different from last year's—which of course was once
### described in the same glowing terms. Politicians love hyperbole too;
### some of them seem convinced that calling a new bill “the worst bill
### ever passed by Congress” or comparing the president to Hitler is a
### great way to win votes.

### hypertension
### High blood pressure.
### • Pregnancy is often accompanied by mild hypertension that doesn't
### threaten the mother's life.
### You might have thought that hypertension was what a movie
### audience feels near the climax of a thriller, but you would have been
### wrong. High blood pressure—that is high pressure against the walls
### of your veins and arteries caused by blood flow—often occurs when
### the arteries or veins become blocked or narrowed, making the heart
### work harder to pump blood. But many cases seem to be the result of
### smoking or taking in too much salt, and many are genetically
### caused. Hypertension is serious, since it can lead to heart attacks
### and strokes. Though it often produces no warning symptoms, your
### blood pressure can be checked quickly and easily by a nurse. If it's
### high, it can usually be controlled by stopping smoking, losing weight,
### lowering your salt intake, and exercising—and if all else fails, by
### medication.

### hyperventilate
### To breathe rapidly and deeply.
### • They laughed so hard they began to hyperventilate and feel giddy.
### Hyperventilating can be a response to fear and anxiety. A test pilot
### who panics and hyperventilates faces a dangerous situation. When
### the level of carbon dioxide in your blood goes down and the oxygen
### level goes up, blood vessels constrict because of the chemical
### changes and the body can't get enough oxygen (even though it's
### there in the blood), and the pilot can become lightheaded and may
### even faint. To guard against this, pilots are taught to control their
### breathing. On the ground, the usual remedy for hyperventilation is
### breathing into a paper bag, which raises the level of carbon dioxide
### and restores normal breathing.

### PRE
### , one of the most common of all English prefixes, comes from
### prae, the Latin word meaning “before” or “in front of.” So a
### prediction forecasts what will happen before it occurs. The 5:00 TV
### news precedes the 6:00 news. And someone with a prejudice
### against a class of people has judged them before having even met
### them.

### preclude
### To make impossible beforehand; prevent.
### • If we accept this cash offer from the company, that will preclude
### our joining in the big suit against it with the other investors.
### Preclude is often used in legal writing, where it usually refers to
### making something legally impossible. A new law may be passed by
### Congress to preclude any suits of a certain kind against a federal
### agency, for example. Some judges have found that the warnings on
### cigarette packs preclude any suits against the tobacco companies by
### lung-cancer sufferers. But there are plenty of nonlegal uses as well.
### Bad weather often precludes trips to the beach, and a lack of cash
### might preclude any beach vacation at all.

### precocious
### Showing the qualities or abilities of an
### adult at an unusually early age.
### • Everyone agrees that their seven-year-old daughter is smart and
### precocious, but she's also getting rather full of herself.
### Growing from a child to an adult is like the slow ripening of fruit, and
### that's the image that gave us precocious. The word is based on the
### Latin verb coquere, meaning “to ripen” or “to cook,” but it comes
### most directly from the adjective praecox, which means “ripening
### early or before its time.” Precocity can occasionally be annoying; but
### precocious children don't come precooked, only “preripened.”

### predispose
### (1) To influence in advance in order to
### create a particular attitude. (2) To make one more likely to develop a
### particular disease or physical condition.
### • Growing up in a house full of sisters had predisposed her to find
### her friendships with other women.
### Predispose usually means putting someone in a frame of mind to be
### willing to do something. So a longtime belief in the essential
### goodness of people, for example, will predispose us to trust a
### stranger. Teachers know that coming from a stable family generally
### predisposes children to learn. And viewing television violence for
### years may leave young people with a predisposition to accept real
### violence as normal. The medical sense of the word is similar. Thus, a
### person's genes may predispose her to diabetes or arthritis, and
### malnutrition over a long period can predispose you to all kinds of
### infections.

### prerequisite
### Something that is required in
### advance to achieve a goal or to carry out a function.
### • In most states, minimal insurance coverage is a prerequisite for
### registering an automobile.
### Prerequisite is partly based on requirere, the Latin verb meaning “to
### need or require.” So a prerequisite can be anything that must be
### accomplished or acquired before something else can be done.
### Possessing a valid credit card is a prerequisite for renting a car. A
### physical exam may be a prerequisite for receiving a life-insurance
### policy. And successful completion of an introductory course is often a
### prerequisite for enrolling in a higher-level course.

### PARA
### is a Greek prefix usually meaning “beside” or “closely related
### to.” So parallel lines run beside each other. And a Greek paragraphos
### was originally a line written beside the main text of a play to show
### where a new person begins speaking; today we just start a new
### paragraph on a new line.

### paraphrase
### To restate the meaning (of something
### written or spoken) in different words.
### • She started off the class by asking one of the students to
### paraphrase the Tennyson poem, to make sure everyone understood
### its basic meaning.
### When we paraphrase, we provide a version that can exist beside the
### original (rather than replace it). We paraphrase all the time. When
### you tell a friend what someone else has said, you're almost always
### paraphrasing, since you're not repeating the exact words. If you go
### to hear a talk, you might paraphrase the speaker's main points
### afterward for your friends. And when writing a paper on a short
### story, you might start off your essay with a paraphrase of the plot.
### Paraphrasing is especially useful when dealing with poetry, since
### poetic language is often difficult and poems may have meanings that
### are hard to pin down.

### paralegal
### Of, relating to, or being a trained assistant
### to a lawyer.
### • Part of the firm's business involved researching real-estate
### properties, which the senior lawyers regarded as paralegal work.
### Much of the work in a law office can be done by paralegal assistants,
### also called legal aides or simply paralegals, who work alongside
### licensed lawyers. Often a paralegal is trained in a narrow field and
### then entrusted with it. In this respect, paralegals are similar to
### paraprofessionals
### in
### other
### fields,
### such
### as
### engineering.
### Paraprofessionals used to be trained in the office itself, but today it's
### common to study for a paraprofessional certificate or degree at a
### community college or university.

### paramedic
### A specially trained medical technician
### licensed to provide a wide range of emergency services before or
### during transportation to a hospital.
### • Five ambulances had already arrived, and a dozen paramedics
### were crouched over the victims with bandages and IVs.
### In ground warfare, wounded troops must usually be transported
### from the front lines back to field hospitals, and trained paramedical
### personnel—that is, nondoctors, usually known as medics or
### corpsmen—were first widely used in such situations. It took many
### decades for the wartime model to be applied effectively to ordinary
### peacetime medicine. With advances in medical technology (such as
### defibrillators, for restarting a heart after a heart attack), paramedics
### became an essential part of emergency medicine, and today
### hundreds of thousands of people owe their lives to paramedics.
### Paraprofessionals who work only in hospitals and clinics usually go
### by other titles.

### paramilitary
### Relating to a force formed on a
### military pattern, especially as a possible backup military force.
### • In the country's most remote regions, the real power was held by
### large landowners, who actually kept paramilitary forces, their own
### private armies, on their estates.
### This term paramilitary can take in a wide range of organizations, but
### is usually applied to forces formed by a government. Groups
### opposing a government, even when organized along military lines,
### are more often referred to as guerrillas or insurgents. In countries
### with weak central governments (such as, in recent times,
### Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, or Congo), warlords may form their own
### paramilitary forces and take over all local police and military
### functions. Paramilitary often has a sinister sound today, since it's
### also applied to groups of off-duty military or police personnel who
### carry out illegal violence, often at night, with the quiet support of a
### government.

### Answers

### META
### is a prefix in English that generally means “behind” or
### “beyond.” In medicine, for example, the metacarpal bones are the
### hand bones that come right after, or beyond, the carpal or wrist
### bones. And metalanguage is language used to talk about language,
### which requires going beyond normal language.

### metadata
### Data that provides information about
### other data.
### • Before putting videos up on the Web site, she always tags them
### with a decent set of metadata.
### Metadata is electronic data that somehow describes an electronic file
### or its contents, and is usually included in the file itself. An important
### use for metadata is for searching. A piece of metadata might identify
### the file, its size, the date it was compiled, its nature, and so on.
### Metadata is particularly important for making pictures searchable;
### since a picture of a landscape in the Southwest, for example, can't
### be “read” by a search engine, data tags such as “Southwest,”
### “mesa,” and “arroyo” might be included in the digitized image file.
### The same can be done for audio files; the tags for a speech might
### read “Gore,” “climate,” and “Copenhagen.” Metadata tags for a Web
### page, including tags identifying its most important content, ensure
### that the page won't be overlooked by a search engine.

### metaphorical
### Relating to a figure of speech in
### which a word or phrase meaning one kind of object or idea is used
### in place of another to suggest a similarity between them.
### • He always points out to his classes that metaphors can be found in
### poetry of all kinds, from “The eyes are the windows of the soul” to
### “You ain't nothin' but a hound dog.”
### Metaphor comes from a Greek word meaning “transfer” (or, to stay
### close to its roots, “carry beyond”). Thus, a metaphor transfers the
### meaning of one word or phrase to another. Metaphors often include
### a form of the verb be (as in the examples above), and they're often
### contrasted with similes, which are usually introduced by like or as
### (“O, my luve's like a red, red rose”). But, they don't have to include
### be; when you say that the teacher gave us a mountain of homework
### or that we're drowning in paperwork, these too are metaphorical
### statements.

### metaphysics
### The part of philosophy having to do
### with the ultimate causes and basic nature of things.
### • Most of the congregation prefers to hear their minister preach
### about virtue, and they get restless when his sermons head in the
### direction of metaphysics.
### Just as physics deals with the laws that govern the physical world
### (such as those of gravity or the properties of waves), metaphysics
### describes what is beyond physics—the nature and origin of reality
### itself, the immortal soul, and the existence of a supreme being.
### Opinions about these metaphysical topics vary widely, since what's
### being discussed can't be observed or measured or even truly known
### to exist. So most metaphysical questions are still as far from a final
### answer as they were when Plato and Aristotle were asking them.

### metonymy
### A figure of speech in which the name of
### one thing is used for the name of something else that is associated
### with it or related to it.
### • When Wall Street has the jitters, the White House issues a
### statement, and the people wait for answers from City Hall,
### metonymy is having a busy day.
### At first glance, metaphor and metonymy seem close in meaning, but
### there are differences. In a metaphor we substitute one thing for
### something else that's usually quite different; for example, Web for a
### worldwide network of linked computers and their technology. In
### metonymy, we replace one word or phrase (such as “stock market”
### or “local government officials” in the examples above) with another
### word or phrase associated with it. Most familiar metonyms are place-
### names, such as Hollywood for “the film industry,” or K Street for
### “Washington lobbyists.” But saying “the press” to refer to the news
### media, or “sweat” to refer to hard work, could also be called
### metonymy.

### PER
### is a Latin preposition that generally means “through,”
### “throughout,” or “thoroughly.” Thus, perforate means “to bore
### through,” perennial means “throughout the years,” and permanent
### means “remaining throughout.” And the “thoroughly” sense shows
### up in persuade, for “thoroughly advise,” and perverted, “thoroughly
### turned around.”

### percolate
### (1) To trickle or filter through something
### porous. (2) To become spread through.
### • She tells herself that the money she spends on luxuries eventually
### percolates down to the needy.
### Percolate comes from a Latin verb meaning “to put through a sieve.”
### Something that percolates filters through something else, just as
### small particles pass through a sieve. Water is drawn downward
### through the soil, and this percolation usually cleans the water. A
### slow rain is ideal for percolating into the soil, since in a violent
### rainstorm most of it quickly runs off. For this reason, drip irrigation is
### the most effective and water-conserving form of irrigation.
### Percolation isn't always a physical process; awareness of an issue
### may percolate slowly into the minds of the public, just as Spanish
### words may gradually percolate into English, often starting in the
### Southwest.

### pervade
### To spread through all parts of something.
### • We all knew that more job cuts were coming, and the entire office
### was pervaded with anxiety.
### Pervade can be used to describe something physical: a chemical
### odor may pervade a building, for example, and most scientists
### believe that outer space is pervaded by mysterious “dark matter.”
### But the word usually doesn't refer to anything that could be detected
### by scientific instruments. Thus, humor may pervade a novel, gloom
### may pervade a gathering, and corruption may pervade a
### government. And something pervasive exists in every part of
### something: fatherlessness may be a pervasive problem in poor
### neighborhoods, for instance, and pervasive optimism sometimes
### causes the stock market to soar.

### permeate
### (1) To spread throughout. (2) To pass
### through the pores or small openings of.
### • On Saturday mornings back in those days, the aroma of fresh pies
### and breads would permeate almost every house on the block.
### Permeate is often a synonym for pervade. We could say, for
### example, that at exam time the campus is either “permeated” or
### “pervaded” by a sense of dread. But the two words aren't identical.
### For one thing, permeate can mean simply “pass through,” and is
### often used when talking about liquids; thus, a boot can be
### permeated by water, though certain oils make leather less
### permeable, and you might just want to buy boots made of
### impermeable material. And things may “pass through” in a
### nonphysical way as well; so you might say that anxiety about climate
### change has started to permeate into the public's consciousness—but
### once anxiety has become pervasive it's pretty much taken over.

### persevere
### To keep at something in spite of difficulties,
### opposition, or discouragement.
### • For ten years she persevered in her effort to find out what the
### government knew about her husband's disappearance.
### The early settlers of the New World persevered in the face of
### constant hardship and danger. The Pilgrims of Plymouth Plantation
### lost half their number in the first winter to disease and hunger, but
### their perseverance paid off, and within five years their community
### was healthy and self-sufficient. Perhaps more remarkable are all the
### solitary inventors who have persevered in pursuing their visions for
### years, lacking any financial support and laughed at by the public.

### Answers

### ANT/ANTI
### is a Latin prefix meaning “against.” An anticlimax is the
### opposite of a climax. An antiseptic or antibiotic fights germs. An
### antacid attacks acid in the stomach. And an antidote works against
### the effects of a poison.

### antagonist
### A person who opposes or is unfriendly
### toward another; an opponent.
### • With supplies ordered from the Acme Company, Road Runner's
### constant antagonist, Wile E. Coyote, attempts one dastardly deed
### after another.
### On the stage or screen, in a story or a novel, the protagonist is the
### main character and the antagonist is the opposing one. Pro- and
### ant- usually mark the good and bad characters, but not always;
### there may occasionally be an evil protagonist and a good antagonist.
### In the drama of the real world, it's especially hard to sort out which
### is which, so we usually speak of both parties to a conflict as
### antagonists. During a strike, for example, representatives of labor
### and management become antagonists; they often manage to
### antagonize each other, and the antagonism often remains after the
### strike is over.

### antigen
### A chemical substance (such as a protein) that,
### when introduced into the body, causes the body to form antibodies
### against it.
### • When the immune system is weak, it may not be able to produce
### enough antibodies to combat the invading antigens.
### An antibody is a protein produced by your immune system to fight
### outside invaders. Since the enemy substance actually triggers the
### production of antibodies, such substances are called antigens—anti-
### being short for antibody, and -gen meaning “producer.” (In a similar
### way, an allergen produces an allergy, and a pathogen produces a
### pathology or disease.) Antigens are often rodlike structures that stick
### out from the surface of an invading organism—usually a bacterium
### or a virus—and allow it to attach itself to cells in the invaded body.
### But unfortunately for them, in doing so they let the immune system
### know they're present, and the body is flooded with an army of Pac-
### Man-like antibodies.

### antipathy
### A strong dislike.
### • It seemed odd that he could feel such intense antipathy for
### someone he'd only met once, and we suspected there was more to
### the story.
### When the nation of Yugoslavia was created in 1945, it combined a
### number of ethnic groups with a history of violent antipathy toward
### each other. In 1991–92 four regions of the country announced that
### they would become independent nations; a bloody six-year war
### followed, fueled by these ancient and powerful antipathies. The
### American Civil War similarly resulted from antipathy between the
### North and the South. But in the U.S.'s relations with its next-door
### neighbors, it's been a long time since emotions have gotten much
### stronger than annoyance.

### antithesis
### (1) The contrast or opposition of ideas.
### (2) The exact opposite.
### • Life on the small college campus, with its personal freedom and
### responsibility, was the antithesis of what many students had known
### in high school.
### Writers and speechmakers use the traditional pattern known as
### antithesis for its resounding effect; John Kennedy's famous “ask not
### what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your
### country” is an example. But antithesis normally means simply
### “opposite.” Thus, war is the antithesis of peace, wealth is the
### antithesis of poverty, and love is the antithesis of hate. Holding two
### antithetical ideas in one's head at the same time—for example, that
### you're the sole master of your fate but also the helpless victim of
### your terrible upbringing—is so common as to be almost normal.

### CONTRA
### is the Latin equivalent of anti-, and it too means
### essentially “against” or “contrary to.” A contrast “stands against”
### something else that it's compared to. And contrapuntal music, as in
### the music of Bach, sets one melody against another played at the
### same time and produces harmony (which no one is opposed to).

### contraband
### Goods that are forbidden by law to be
### owned or brought into or out of a country; smuggled goods.
### • Late at night he would go driving through the desert on the
### interstate, peddling his contraband to wary gas-station attendants.
### In Latin a bannus was an order or decree, so a contrabannum was
### something that went against a decree. This led to the Italian word
### contrabbando, from which we get contraband. Contraband items
### aren't always illegal; they may simply be things (such as cigarettes)
### that are meant to be taxed. So a dealer in untaxed contraband can
### charge a little less and still make enormous profits. Of course, if the
### item is actually forbidden, like illegal drugs, then the profits could be
### much greater.

### contraindication
### Something (such as a
### symptom or condition) that makes a particular treatment,
### medication, or procedure likely to be unsafe.
### • A history of stomach ulcers is a contraindication to regular use of
### aspirin.
### For doctors, an indication is a symptom or circumstance that makes
### a particular medical treatment desirable. Serious anxiety, for
### example, is often an indication for prescribing a tranquilizer. A
### contraindication, then, is a symptom or condition that makes a
### treatment risky, such as taking certain other medications at the
### same time. Drugs and conditions that are contraindicated for a
### medication are listed on its label, and reeled off at high speed in TV
### ads. Patients can guard against the dangers of drug interaction by
### reading labels carefully and making sure their doctors know what
### else they're currently taking.

### contravene
### (1) To go against or act contrary to; to
### violate. (2) To oppose in an argument, to contradict.
### • The power company was found to be contravening state and
### federal environmental standards for wastewater discharged into
### bodies of water.
### Contravene is most often used in reference to laws. So a
### government may take a company to court claiming that its policies
### are in contravention of national labor laws. The contravention of
### copyright laws is a big topic today especially where electronic
### information is involved. And a country might be punished if a trade
### organization finds that it's contravening international trade
### agreements.

### contrarian
### A person who takes a contrary position
### or attitude, especially an investor who buys shares of stock when
### most others are selling or sells when others are buying.
### • My father was basically a contrarian, who never accepted the
### common wisdom and loved nothing so much as a good argument.
### Anyone who thinks that most of what the public believes is wrong
### would be called a contrarian. And contrarian is a basic term in the
### vocabulary of investing. In fact, most successful investors often
### behave like contrarians by “buying low and selling high”—that is,
### buying stocks that are cheap because most investors put a low value
### on them but that have the possibility of rising, and selling stocks that
### most investors are valuing highly but that seem likely to decline. The
### word may be most common as an adjective; so you may express a
### contrarian opinion, hold a contrarian view, or pursue a contrarian
### investment strategy.

## Greek and Latin Borrowings
### in memoriam
### In memory of.
### • The message on the pedestal begins “In memoriam” and then lists
### the names of the local young men who died in World War I.
### Since the days of the Roman empire, the words In memoriam,
### followed by a name, have been found on monuments and
### gravestones. They may also appear in the dedication of a book or
### poem; Alfred Tennyson's greatest poem is his immense In
### Memoriam, written over a period of 17 years to mourn the death of
### his dear friend Arthur Hallam.

### magnum opus
### A great work, especially the
### greatest achievement of an artist, composer, or writer.
### • No one was exactly sure what the massive novel was about, but
### everyone was certain that it was his magnum opus.
### The greatest work of a great artist may be hard to agree on. Many
### would pick Rembrandt's The Night Watch, Mozart's Don Giovanni,
### Ovid's Metamorphoses, Dante's Divine Comedy, Wren's St. Paul's
### Cathedral, and Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel murals. But for
### Shakespeare, would it be Hamlet or King Lear? For Mahler, The Song
### of the Earth or the Ninth Symphony? For the Marx Brothers, A Day
### at the Races or A Night at the Opera?

### memento mori
### A reminder of mortality,
### especially a human skull symbolizing death.
### • The first twinges of arthritis often serve as a vivid memento mori
### for middle-aged jocks trying to ignore their advancing years.
### Memento mori literally means “Remember you must die.” The early
### Puritan settlers were particularly aware of death and fearful of what
### it might mean, so a Puritan tombstone will often display a memento
### mori intended for the living. These death's-heads or skulls may strike
### us as ghoulish, but they helped keep the living on the straight and
### narrow for fear of eternal punishment. In earlier centuries, an
### educated European might place an actual skull on his desk to keep
### the idea of death always present in his mind.

### habeas corpus
### An order to bring a jailed
### person before a judge or court to find out if that person should really
### be in jail.
### • The country has a primitive legal system with no right of habeas
### corpus, and suspects often are shot before they ever see a judge.
### The literal meaning of habeas corpus is “You shall have the body”—
### that is, the judge must have the person charged with a crime
### brought into the courtroom to hear what he's been charged with.
### Through much of human history, and in many countries still today, a
### person may be imprisoned on the orders of someone in the
### government and kept behind bars for years without ever getting a
### chance to defend himself, or even knowing what he's done wrong.
### In England, the right to be brought before a judge to hear the
### charges and answer them was written into law over 300 years ago,
### and the U.S. adopted the British practice in its Constitution.

### rigor mortis
### The temporary rigidity of muscles
### that sets in after death.
### • The coroner could tell from the progress of rigor mortis that death
### had occurred no more than six hours earlier.
### Rigor mortis, which translates from Latin as “stiffness of death,” sets
### in quickly and usually ends three or four days after death. The
### condition results from a lack of certain chemicals in the muscles; it
### may be affected by muscular activity before death as well as the
### external temperature. Mystery writers frequently make use of rigor
### mortis as a means by which the detective or the examiner can
### determine the time of the victim's death, which often turns out to be
### all-important in solving the case.

### sine qua non
### An essential thing.
### • Good planning is the sine qua non of a successful dinner party.
### Sine qua non can be translated literally as “Without which, not.”
### Though this may sound like gibberish, it means more or less
### “Without (something), (something else) won't be possible.” Sine qua
### non sounds slightly literary, and it shouldn't be used just anywhere.
### But it actually shows up in many contexts, including business (“A
### solid customer base is the sine qua non to success”), show business
### (“A good agent is a sine qua non for an actor's career”), and politics
### (“His support was really the sine qua non for her candidacy”).

### tabula rasa
### (1) The mind in its blank or
### unmarked state before receiving any impressions from outside. (2)
### Something existing in its original pure state.
### • As for knowing what life outside of his little village was like, he was
### practically a tabula rasa.
### In ancient Rome, a student in class would write on a wax-covered
### wooden tablet, or tabula, using a sticklike implement. At the end of
### the day, the marks could be scraped off, leaving a fresh, unmarked
### tablet—a tabula rasa—for the next day's lessons. But even before
### the Romans, the Greek philosopher Aristotle had called the mind at
### birth an “unmarked tablet.” We still use the term today, but usually
### not very seriously; with what we know about biology and genetics,
### most of us don't really think there's nothing in a mind at birth.

### terra incognita
### An unexplored country or
### field of knowledge.
### • We've been to Phoenix once, but otherwise Arizona is terra
### incognita.
### When Roman mapmakers drew a land area that no one had yet
### explored, they often labeled it “Terra Incognita”—that is, “Unknown
### Territory”—and the term continued to be used for centuries
### afterward. When Columbus and his successors first crossed the
### Atlantic, they entered upon terra incognita, a land that came to be
### called the “New World.” But the term is just as useful for mental
### exploration. For most of us, subjects such as particle physics, French
### 17th-century drama, and soil mechanics are terra incognita, and we
### can only hope to live long enough to be able to explore some of
### them someday.
