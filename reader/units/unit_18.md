### CAPIT
### , from the Latin word for “head,” caput, turns up in some
### important places. The head of a ship is its captain, and the capital of
### a state or country is where the “head of state” works. A capital letter
### stands head and shoulders above a lowercase letter, as well as at
### the head (beginning) of a sentence.

### capitalism
### An economic system based on
### private ownership, private decisions, and open competition in a free
### market.
### • In the 1980s, the leaders of the free world had faith that capitalism
### and a free-market economy would solve all our problems.
### Capital is wealth—that is, money and goods—that's used to produce
### more wealth. Capitalism is practiced enthusiastically by capitalists,
### people who use capital to increase production and make more goods
### and money. Capitalism works by encouraging competition in a fair
### and open market. Its opposite is often said to be socialism. Where a
### capitalist economy encourages private actions and ownership,
### socialism prefers public or government ownership and control of
### parts of the economy. In a pure capitalist system, there would be no
### public schools or public parks, no government programs such as
### Social Security and Medicare, and maybe not even any public
### highways or police. In a pure socialist system, there wouldn't be any
### private corporations. In other words, there's just about no such thing
### as pure capitalism or pure socialism in the modern world.

### capitulate
### To surrender or stop resisting; give up.
### • At 2:00 a.m. the last three senators finally capitulated, allowing the
### bill to move forward.
### Capitulation often refers to surrender on the battlefield. Originally it
### only referred to surrender according to an agreement, though that
### part of the meaning is often absent. Today a teacher can capitulate
### to her students' cries of protest against a homework assignment, or
### a father can capitulate to his kids' pleas to stop for ice cream, when
### the only terms of the agreement are that they'll stop complaining.

### decapitate
### (1) To cut off the head; behead. (2) To
### destroy or make useless.
### • The leaders of the uprising were decapitated, and their heads were
### mounted on long poles on London Bridge as a warning to the
### people.
### Decapitation is a quick and fairly painless way to go, so it was once
### considered suitable only for nobles like Sir Walter Raleigh, Mary
### Queen of Scots, and two of Henry VIII's unfortunate wives. The
### invention of the guillotine in the 18th century was meant to make
### execution swifter and more painless than hanging or a badly aimed
### blow by the executioner's sword.

### recapitulate
### To repeat or summarize the most
### important points or stages.
### • At the end of his talk, the president carefully recapitulated the
### main points in order.
### Capitulation originally meant the organizing of material under
### headings. So recapitulation usually involves the gathering of the
### main ideas in a brief summary. But a recapitulation may be a
### complete restatement as well. In many pieces of classical music, the
### recapitulation, or recap, is the long final section of a movement,
### where the earlier music is restated in the main key.

### ANTHROP
### comes from the Greek word for “human being.” So an
### anthropomorphic god, such as Zeus or Athena, basically looks and
### acts like a human. And in Aesop's fables and many animated
### cartoons, animals are usually anthropomorphized and behave exactly
### like furry, four-legged human beings.

### anthropoid
### Any of several large, tailless apes.
### • The chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, gibbons, and bonobos are
### all classified as anthropoids.
### With its suffix -oid, meaning “resembling,” the word anthropoid
### means literally “resembling a human being.” Anthropoid apes are so
### called because they resemble humans more closely than do other
### primates such as monkeys and lemurs. Some even spend a good
### deal of time walking on their hind legs. Anthropoids are, of course,
### highly intelligent (though maybe no more so than many monkeys),
### and some of them use sticks and stones as tools. (But if you call
### someone an anthropoid, you're probably not complimenting his
### intelligence.)

### anthropology
### The science and study of human
### beings.
### • By studying the cultures of primitive peoples, anthropology may
### give us a better understanding of our own culture.
### Anthropologists, those who study the whys and wherefores of
### human existence, today look not only at the tribes of the Amazon
### but also at the neighborhoods of Brooklyn or Santa Monica. Every
### group and every culture now seems to be possible material for
### anthropology. Some anthropologists specialize in the study of human
### evolution, some study human language, some study archaeology,
### and some study human culture through the ages. Unlike historians,
### they tend to focus less on what has been recorded in writings than
### on what can be discovered in other ways.

### misanthropic
### Hating or distrusting humans.
### • Few characters in literature are more misanthropic than Ebenezer
### Scrooge, who cares for nothing but money.
### Jonathan Swift was famous for the misanthropy of works such as
### Gulliver's Travels which make fun of all kinds of human foolishness.
### But in spite of his apparent misanthropic attitude, he spent a third of
### his income on founding a hospital and another third on other
### charities—certainly not the acts of a true misanthrope. Today we
### often use synonyms such as cynic and grinch for misanthropic types
### —while hoping we don't meet too many of them.

### lycanthropy
### (1) A delusion that one has become a
### wolf. (2) Transformation into a wolf through witchcraft or magic.
### • The local farmers avoided the residents of the village in the next
### valley, who had long been suspected of grave robbing and
### lycanthropy.
### The Greek word for “wolf,” lykos, combines with the anthro- root to
### produce the meaning “wolfman.” In European folklore, dating back
### to the ancient Greeks and Romans, there are men who change into
### wolves at night and devour animals, people, or graveyard corpses
### before returning to human form at dawn. Werewolves, or
### lycanthropes, may be evil and possessed by the devil, or may
### instead be the victims of a werewolf bite and thereby cursed to
### change into wolf form at the full moon. The werewolf's evil intention
### is shown by its eating only part of the animal or corpse, rather than
### all of it like a truly hungry wolf.

### KINE
### comes from the Greek word kinesis, meaning “movement.”
### Kinetic energy is the energy of motion (as opposed to potential
### energy, the kind of energy held by a stretched elastic band). Kinetic
### art is art that has moving parts, such as Alexander Calder's famous
### mobiles. And cinema, the art of moving pictures, actually comes
### from the same kine- root as well.

### kinesiology
### The scientific study of human
### movement.
### • With a kinesiology degree in hand, she landed a job as a rehab
### therapist for patients following heart surgery.
### Kinesiologists study the acquisition of motor skills, the mechanical
### aspects of movement, and the body's responses to physical activity.
### A kinesiologist may work in a public-school fitness program, design
### exercise programs for people with and without disabilities, or work
### with patients recovering from disease, accidents, and surgery. As a
### field of research, kinesiology focuses particularly on the mechanics
### of muscular activity.

### hyperkinetic
### (1) Relating to or affected with
### hyperactivity. (2) Characterized by fast-paced or frantic activity.
### • Noises Off is a hyperkinetic stage farce that moves at a breathless
### pace for a full hour and a half.
### Since the prefix hyper- means “above, beyond” (see
### HYPER
### ),
### hyperkinetic describes motion beyond the usual. The word is usually
### applied to children, and often describes the condition of almost
### uncontrollable activity or muscular movements called attention-
### deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Kids with ADHD are usually
### not just hyperkinetic but also inattentive, forgetful, and flighty.
### Though they're often treated with drugs, many experts believe there
### are better ways of dealing with the problem. Lots of people now
### shorten both hyperactive and hyperkinetic to simply hyper (“He's
### been hyper all morning”), but usually don't mean it too seriously.

### kinescope
### A motion picture made from an image on
### a picture tube.
### • In the archives she turned up several kinescopes of Ernie Kovacs's
### 1950s show, which she thought had been dumped into New York
### Harbor decades ago.
### Kinescope, originally a trademark for the cathode-ray tube in a TV,
### later became the name for a film of a TV screen showing a live
### broadcast. In order for a program to be seen beyond New York in
### the early days of TV, a kinescope had to be shipped from station to
### station. Though grainy and fuzzy, these were for a time the only way
### of capturing live shows. But in 1951 Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball
### decided to film their comedy show rather than to broadcast it live,
### and in a few years live broadcast comedy and drama had vanished
### from the airwaves.

### telekinesis
### The movement of objects without
### contact or other physical means, as by the exercise of an occult
### power.
### • Fascinated by telekinesis as a boy, he'd spent hours in his room
### trying to push a pencil off the table using only his mind.
### Tele- in Greek means “far off” (see
### TELE
### ). The eternally appealing
### idea of moving an object remotely, using only psychic powers, has
### had a long life in films, TV shows, stories and novels, video games,
### and comics. But although some researchers believe in the existence
### of telekinesis (also known as psychokinesis), most scientists believe
### that any reported experiences have been the result of fraud, wishful
### thinking, or naturally explainable events.

### DYNAM
### comes from the Greek dynamis, meaning “power.” A dyne is
### a unit used in measuring force; an instrument that measures force is
### called a dynamometer. And when Alfred Nobel invented a powerful
### explosive in 1867, he named it dynamite.

### dynamic
### (1) Relating to physical force or energy. (2)
### Continuously and productively active and changing; energetic or
### forceful.
### • The situation has entered a dynamic phase, and what we knew
### about it last week has changed considerably by now.
### Dynamic is the opposite of static, which means “not moving or
### active.” So all living languages, for example, are dynamic rather than
### static, changing from year to year even when they don't appear to
### be. A bustling commercial city like Hong Kong is intensely dynamic,
### constantly changing and adapting. A dynamic relationship—for
### example, the relationship between housing values and interest rates
### charged by banks—is one that changes all the time. Unfortunately,
### the word has been used so much by advertisers that we tend to
### forget its basic meaning.

### dynamo
### (1) A power generator, especially one that
### produces direct electric current. (2) A forceful, energetic person.
### • Even as they entered the power plant, the roar of the water
### covered the sound of the immense dynamos.
### The dynamo was introduced in 1832 to produce electricity for
### commercial use. Like all later generators, the original dynamos
### changed mechanical energy (produced by steam, which was itself
### produced by burning coal) into electricity. The word is less used
### today than it once was, since it's often applied only to generators
### that produced direct electric current (DC) rather than alternating
### current (AC), which is now the standard. A human dynamo is a
### person who seems to have unlimited energy, such as New York's
### legendary mayor Fiorello La Guardia, whose forcefulness and vigor
### matched that of his intensely dynamic city.

### aerodynamics
### (1) A science that studies the
### movement of gases such as air and the way that objects move
### through such gases. (2) The qualities of an object that affect how
### easily it is able to move through the air.
### • Early automobile designs were based on the boxlike carriages
### drawn by horses, back when no one was even thinking about
### aerodynamics.
### Aerodynamics began as a science around the time of the Wright
### brothers' first manned flights. Since then, it's become important to
### the building not only of aircraft and automobiles but also of rockets
### and missiles, trains, ships, and even such structures as bridges and
### tall buildings, which often have to withstand strong winds. An
### aerodynamic vehicle is one whose design helps it achieve the
### greatest speed and most efficient use of fuel. But although we might
### casually call any sleek car design aerodynamic, true aerodynamics is
### practiced not by artistic product designers but instead by highly
### trained scientists, and many people's lives depend on their work.

### hydrodynamic
### Having to do with the science
### that studies fluids in motion and the forces that act on bodies
### surrounded by fluids.
### • Building levees to contain a flood presents complicated
### hydrodynamic problems.
### Bernoulli's principle, which is basic to the science of hydrodynamics,
### says that the faster a fluid substance flows, the less outward
### pressure it exerts. It shows the close relationship between
### hydrodynamics and aerodynamics (which deals with the movement
### of air and other gases), since it can partly explain how air will “lift”
### an airplane by the way it flows over the wings, and how a spoiler
### helps keep a race car's wheels pressed to the ground as it
### accelerates. Hydrodynamics is sometimes applied today in studying
### the surface of the planets and even the stars. As used informally by
### boaters, hydrodynamic often means “hydrodynamically efficient.”

### GRAD
### comes from the Latin noun gradus, “step” or “degree,” and
### the verb gradi, “to step, walk.” A grade is a step up or down on a
### scale of some kind, and a gradual change takes place in small steps.

### gradation
### (1) A series made up of successive
### stages. (2) A step in an ordered scale.
### • In the fall, the leaves show gradations of color from deepest red to
### brightest yellow.
### In the Boy Scouts, gradations of rank move upward from Tenderfoot
### to Eagle Scout. A violin or a voice can produce gradations of musical
### pitch too small to appear in written music. In the 18th century
### Jonathan Swift could even write of “the several kinds and gradations
### of laughter, which ladies must daily practice by the looking-glass.”

### degrade
### (1) To treat someone or something poorly and
### without respect. (2) To make the quality of something worse.
### • They had feared for years that television was degrading the mental
### capacities of their children.
### In Shakespeare's King Lear, the old king is degraded by the
### daughters he has given his kingdom to. He finds it degrading, for
### instance, when the number of his guards is reduced from 100 to 25.
### His degradation seems complete when, after going mad, he's
### reduced to living in the wilderness. As you can see, degrade is often
### a synonym for humiliate.

### gradient
### (1) Slope, grade. (2) A continuous change in
### measure, activity, or substance.
### • Steep temperature gradients in the atmosphere are usually
### associated with unstable conditions.
### Any slope can be called a gradient. In the interstate highway system,
### the maximum gradient is 6 percent; in other words, the highway
### may never ascend more than 6 vertical feet over a distance of 100
### feet. Any rate of change that's shown on a graph may have a sloped
### gradient. Suppose the graph's horizontal axis shows the passage of
### time and its vertical axis shows some activity; if the activity is
### happening very fast, then the gradient of the line on the graph will
### be steep, but if it's slow the gradient will be gentle, or gradual.

### retrograde
### (1) Moving or performed in a direction
### that is backward or opposite to the usual direction. (2) Moving
### toward a worse or earlier state.
### • For the government to cover up the findings of its scientific
### research institutes was clearly a retrograde step.
### Retrograde describes backwardness of one kind or another. If a
### country decided to go back to amputating the limbs of criminals, we
### might call that policy retrograde. A retrograde view of women might
### be one that sees them basically as housekeepers. Mars and Jupiter
### show retrograde (backward) motion at some stages of their orbits,
### though this is only because of the way we see them from the earth,
### not because of any real backward movement.

### REG
### , from the Latin regula, meaning “rule,” has given us many
### English words. Something regular follows a rule of some kind, even
### if it's just a law of nature. A regime can be a form of rule or
### government. To regulate an industry means to make and enforce
### rules, or regulations, for it; removing such rules is called
### deregulation.

### regimen
### A regular course of treatment, usually
### involving food, exercise, or medicine.
### • As part of his training regimen, he was now swimming two miles,
### running seven miles, and bicycling 15 miles every day.
### Americans love self-improvement, so they're constantly adopting
### regimens: skin-care regimens, low-cholesterol regimens, weight-loss
### regimens, and the like. A course of medication may be complicated
### enough to deserve the name regimen, and a rehab regimen may
### require having your activities monitored at a treatment center.
### Mental regimens can also be valuable; researchers are finding that
### minds that get the most exercise seem to last the longest.

### interregnum
### (1) The time during which a throne
### is vacant between two successive reigns or regimes. (2) A period
### during which the normal functions of government or control are
### suspended.
### • During the weeklong interregnum between the CEO's death and
### the appointment of a new CEO, she felt that she was really running
### the whole show.
### Every time a pope dies, there's an interregnum period before a new
### one is elected by the cardinals. In most democratic systems,
### however, the law specifies who should take office when a president
### or prime minister dies unexpectedly, and since the power usually
### passes automatically, there's no true interregnum. The question of
### succession—that is, of who should take over when a country's leader
### dies—has often presented huge problems for countries that lacked a
### constitution, and in monarchies it hasn't always been clear who
### should become king or queen when a monarch dies. The
### interregnum following the death of Edward VI in 1553, for instance,
### was briefly suspended when Lady Jane Grey was installed as Queen;
### nine days later she was replaced by Mary Tudor, who sent her
### straight to the Tower of London.

### regalia
### (1) The emblems and symbols of royalty. (2)
### Special or official dress.
### • The governor seems to enjoy life in the governor's mansion and all
### the regalia of office more than actually doing his job.
### Just as regal describes a king or queen—that is, a ruler—regalia
### originally meant the things, and especially the dress and decoration,
### that belong exclusively to a monarch. The British monarchy's regalia
### include the crown jewels (crown, scepter, orb, sword, etc.) that lend
### luster to royal coronations. Academic regalia—the caps, gowns, and
### hoods worn by students receiving their degrees—link institutions to
### their past by preserving the dress worn at universities since their
### beginnings in the Middle Ages, when long hooded robes were
### needed for warmth.

### regency
### A government or period of time in which a
### regent rules in place of a king or queen.
### • Since the future king was only four when Louis XIV died, France
### spent eight years under a regency before he took the throne at 13
### as Louis XV.
### In Britain, the years from the time when George III was declared
### insane until his death (1811–1820) are known as the Regency
### period, since in these years his son, the future George IV, served as
### Prince Regent, or acting monarch. (Sometimes the term covers the
### period up to the end of George IV's own reign in 1830.) The
### Regency is remembered for its elegant architecture and fashions, its
### literature (especially the works of Jane Austen), and its politics.
### Today hotels, furniture, and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic
### carry the name “Regency” to identify with the period's style, and
### hundreds of modern romance novels—called simply “Regencies”—
### have been set in the period. Though there have been dozens of
### European regencies over the centuries, for Americans today there
### seems to be only one Regency.

### CRIT
### comes from a Greek verb that means “to judge” or “to
### decide.” So a film critic judges a movie and tells us what's good or
### bad about it. Her critical opinion may convince us not to go, or we
### may overlook any negative criticism and see it anyway.

### criterion
### A standard by which a judgment or decision
### is made.
### • He's one of those readers whose main criterion for liking a book is
### whether it confirms his prejudices.
### One person's principal criterion for a new car may be its gas
### mileage, while someone else's may be whether it has room for four
### children. When filling a job opening, employers usually look for
### several criteria (notice the plural form) in the applicants; and when
### college admissions officers are reading student applications, they
### likewise always keep a few basic criteria in mind. And when
### interviewing an applicant, one criterion for both the employer and
### the admissions officer might include the size of the applicant's
### vocabulary!

### critique
### A judgment or evaluation, especially a rating or
### discussion of merits and faults.
### • Whenever he reads his latest story in the fiction-writing seminar,
### one of the other students always delivers a nasty critique.
### Even though criticize means to judge something negatively, a
### critique can be completely positive—or completely negative. Usually
### it's somewhere in between. When a paper of yours receives a
### critique from a teacher, you should read it carefully, and then reread
### it; getting mad or offended is the worst way to react. Critique is
### often a verb as well. Thus, writers and artists often form groups
### solely to critique each other's work, and scientific articles frequently
### get critiqued in letters to the editor in the following issue of the
### journal.

### hypercritical
### Overly critical.
### • Most teachers do their best to correct their students' mistakes
### without seeming hypercritical.
### The important prefix hyper- means “excessive” or “beyond” (see
### HYPER
### ), so hypercritical means basically “too fussy.” In TV and film
### comedies, the mother-in-law is just about always hypercritical, since
### the person her child married is never good enough for her. But other
### parents, spouses, and even children can be just as bad, so we
### should all be careful. If your father asks what you think of his new
### experimental meatloaf and you say it needs a pinch of oregano,
### you're being constructive; if you say he should cut down on the
### sawdust next time, you're probably being hypercritical.

### hematocrit
### The ratio of the volume of red blood
### cells to whole blood.
### • The latest blood test had revealed that her hematocrit had risen
### considerably and was almost back to normal.
### Our blood is mostly made up of four components: plasma, red blood
### cells, white blood cells, and colorless blood cells called platelets. An
### instrument called a hematocrit (because it “judges” the blood) is
### used to separate a sample of blood into its components. The normal
### hematocrit for men is about 48%, for women about 38%. An
### abnormal proportion of red blood cells, either too many or too few,
### is a good early indicator of many diseases. So when you give blood
### as part of a physical exam, your hematocrit is one of the findings
### your doctor will often check.

### JUR
### comes from the Latin verb jurare, “to swear, take an oath,” and
### the noun jus, “right or law.” A jury, made up of jurors, makes
### judgments based on the law. And a personal injury was originally
### something done to you that a court would find unjust.

### jurisprudence
### (1) A system of law. (2) The
### study and philosophy of law.
### • As a young lawyer his heroes were the crusaders of 20th-century
### jurisprudence, especially Louis Brandeis and Thurgood Marshall.
### Jurisprudence as a study may have begun in the Roman empire,
### where schools of law were first established. And Roman
### jurisprudence, like so many other things the Romans created, served
### as the model in later centuries throughout the Western world. And
### like many other legal words, jurisprudence is used only in formal
### writing.

### abjure
### To reject formally.
### • The Spanish Inquisition forced many Jews to abjure their religion
### and adopt Christianity or be burned at the stake.
### From its Latin roots, abjure would mean literally “to swear away.”
### Thus, after the holidays many people abjure all sweets and fattening
### foods, often making their vow in front of friends or relatives. Abjure
### is often confused with adjure, which means “to command solemnly,
### as if under oath.” Thus, a judge might adjure a criminal to change
### his ways; but it's up to the criminal to abjure a life of crime.

### perjury
### The crime of telling a lie under oath.
### • Found guilty of perjury for lying under oath in front of a
### Congressional committee, he was sentenced to two years in prison.
### The prefix per- in Latin often meant “harmfully.” So witnesses who
### perjure themselves do harm to the truth by knowingly telling a lie.
### Not all lying is perjury, only lying under oath; so perjury generally
### takes place either in court or before a legislative body such as
### Congress. To avoid committing perjury, a witness or defendant may
### “take the Fifth”: that is, refuse to answer a question because the
### answer might be an admission of guilt, and the Fifth Amendment to
### the Constitution forbids forcing a citizen to admit to being guilty of a
### crime.

### de jure
### Based on or according to the law.
### • The country is a de jure democracy, but since one party controls all
### the media outlets it really isn't one.
### Coming straight from Latin, de jure is a term used mostly, but not
### always, in legal writing. Sometimes it's not enough to have
### something written into law; if a law isn't enforced, it might as well
### not exist. And if ordinary citizens are too scared of what would
### happen to them if they exercised their rights, then they don't really
### have those rights at all. Unfortunately, many countries have
### constitutions and laws that sound good but turn out not to have
### much effect. So de jure is almost always used in contrast to
### something else; its opposite is de facto (see
### de facto
### ).

## Number Words
### PENT
### comes from the Greek word for “five.” The Pentagon in
### Washington, D.C., the world's largest office building, has five sides
### just like any other pentagon. And a pentatonic scale in music has
### only five notes, rather than the seven notes of the major or minor
### scale.

### pentathlon
### An athletic contest in which each
### athlete competes in five different events.
### • The modern Olympic pentathlon includes swimming, cross-country
### running, horseback riding, fencing, and target shooting.
### The Greek word athlos means “contest or trial,” so to be an athlete
### you had to compete in physical contests. The ancient Greek
### pentathlon tested warriors' skills in sprinting, long jumping, javelin
### throwing, discus throwing, and wrestling, none of which are part of
### today's Olympic pentathlon. But a pentathlete must still have
### muscles and reflexes suited to almost any kind of physical feat. See
### also
### decathlon
### .

### Pentateuch
### The first five books of the Old
### Testament, traditionally said to have been written by Moses.
### • The Pentateuch takes us from the creation of the world up to the
### Israelites' arrival in the Promised Land.
### Pentateuch means simply “five books.” In Greek, the Pentateuch
### (which Jews call the Torah) includes the books of Genesis, Exodus,
### Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. These contain some of the
### oldest and most famous stories in the Bible, including those of Adam
### and Eve, Jacob and his brothers, and Moses, as well as some of the
### oldest codes of law known, including the Ten Commandments.

### pentameter
### A line of poetry consisting of five
### metrical feet.
### • Shakespeare's tragedies are written mainly in blank verse, which is
### unrhymed iambic pentameter.
### In a line of poetry written in perfect iambic pentameter, there are
### five unstressed syllables, each of which is followed by a stressed
### syllable. Each pair of syllables is a metrical foot called an iamb. Much
### of the greatest poetry in English has been written in iambic
### pentameter; Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton used it more than
### any other meter. Robert Frost's line “I'm going out to clean the
### pasture spring” is an example of it; his “And miles to go before I
### sleep” is instead an example of iambic tetrameter, with only four
### accented syllables.

### Pentecostal
### Of or relating to any of various
### fundamentalist sects that stress personal experience of God and
### vocal expression in worship.
### • Their neighbors belonged to a Pentecostal sect and, homeschooled
### their daughters, who never wore clothes more revealing than floor-
### length skirts and long pants.
### In ancient Greek, pentekoste meant “fiftieth day”—that is, the
### fiftieth day after Easter (counting Easter itself). On that day,
### Christians celebrate an event described in the Bible that took place
### fifty days after Christ's resurrection, when the apostles heard the
### rush of a mighty wind, saw tongues of fire descending on them, and
### heard the Holy Spirit speaking from their own mouths but in other
### tongues (languages). “Speaking in tongues,” when everyone in a
### congregation may begin talking in languages that no one can
### understand, is the best-known practice of Pentecostals. Pentecostals
### belong to many different denominations; with growing numbers
### especially in Latin America and Africa, there may be over 500 million
### Pentecostals worldwide.

### QUINT
### comes from the Latin word meaning “five.” Quintuplets are
### babies that come in sets of five; about 60 U.S. families increase in
### size by that number every year.

### quincentennial
### A 500th anniversary, or the
### celebration of such an event.
### • In 1992 Americans celebrated the quincentennial of Christopher
### Columbus's first voyage to the New World.
### The United States is such a young country that it will be quite some
### time before we reach our quincentennial as a nation: 2276 A.D., to
### be exact. Some American cities will celebrate their quincentennials
### long before that, but even St. Augustine, Florida, the nation's oldest
### city, will have to wait until 2065. Meanwhile, many young people can
### look forward happily to our national tricentennial in 2076; and their
### grandchildren may be around for our quadricentennial in 2176.

### quintessential
### Representing the purest or
### most perfect example of something.
### • As a boy, he had thought of steak, eggs, and home fries as the
### quintessential Saturday breakfast.
### The philosophers and scientists of the ancient world and the Middle
### Ages believed that the world we inhabit was entirely made up of four
### elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Aristotle added a fifth element,
### the aether or ether, by which he meant the material that fills the
### rest of space, mostly invisibly but sometimes taking the form of stars
### and planets. Many writers described the element as a kind of
### invisible light or fire. In the Middle Ages, it was referred to as the
### quinta essentia (“fifth element”). It isn't surprising that the quinta
### essentia came to stand for anything so perfect that it seemed to
### surpass the limitations of earth. Today we generally use
### quintessential rather freely to describe just about anything that
### represents the best of its kind.

### quintet
### (1) A musical piece for five instruments or
### voices. (2) A group of five, such as the performers of a quintet or a
### basketball team.
### • The team's five starters are considered one of the most talented
### quintets in professional basketball.
### A classical quintet is usually written for strings (usually two violins,
### two violas, and a cello) or woodwinds (flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon,
### and horn), but brass quintets (two trumpets, horn, trombone, and
### tuba) have also become popular in North America recently. In jazz,
### Miles Davis led two famous quintets. In pop music, the Miracles, the
### Temptations, and the Jackson 5 were immensely popular vocal
### quintets. In rock, one of the most common instrumental lineups has
### been a quintet consisting of two guitars, a bass, a keyboard, and
### drums; famous rock quintets have included the Grateful Dead and
### the Beach Boys.

### quintile
### One or another of the values that divide a tested
### population into five evenly distributed classes, or one of these
### classes.
### • According to the tests, their one-year-old boy ranks high in the
### second quintile for motor skills.
### Americans love statistics about themselves, whether they inform us
### about our income, ice-cream consumption, or trash production. And
### any such rating can be divided into fifths, or quintiles. The fifth or
### lowest quintile would include the 20 percent of the population who
### make the least money or eat the least ice cream or generate the
### least trash, and the first quintile would include the 20 percent who
### make, eat, or generate the most.
