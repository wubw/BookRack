### TOXI
### comes from the Greek and Latin words for “poison,”
### something the Greeks and Romans knew a good deal about.
### Socrates died by taking a solution of poison hemlock, a flowering
### plant much like wild carrot that now also grows in the U.S. Rome's
### enemy Mithridates, king of Pontus, was obsessed with poisons,
### experimented with them on prisoners, and tried to make himself
### immune to them by eating tiny amounts of them daily. Nero's
### mother Agrippina poisoned several of her son's rivals to power—and
### probably did the same to her own husband, the emperor Claudius.

### toxin
### A substance produced by a living organism (such as
### bacteria) that is highly poisonous to other organisms.
### • Humans eat rhubarb stems without ill effects, while cattle may die
### from eating the leaves, which seem to contain two different toxins.
### Long before chemists started creating poisons from scratch, humans
### were employing natural toxins for killing weeds and insects. For
### centuries South American tribes have used the toxin curare,
### extracted from a native vine, to tip their arrows. The garden flower
### called wolfsbane or monkshood is the source of aconite, an
### extremely potent toxin. The common flower known as jimsonweed
### contains the deadly poison scopolamine. And the castor-oil plant
### yields the almost unbelievably poisonous toxin called ricin. Today we
### hear health advisers of all kinds talk about ridding the body of
### toxins; but they're usually pretty vague about which ones they
### mean, and most of these “toxins” wouldn't be called that by
### biologists.

### toxicity
### The state of being poisonous; the degree to
### which something is poisonous.
### • Though they had tested the drug on animals, they suspected the
### only way to measure its toxicity for humans was by studying
### accidental human exposures.
### Toxicity is often a relative thing; in the words of a famous old saying,
### “The dose makes the poison.” Thus, it's possible to die from drinking
### too much water, and lives have been saved by tiny doses of arsenic.
### Even though botulinum toxin is the most toxic substance known, it's
### the basic ingredient in Botox, which is injected into the face to get
### rid of wrinkles. With some poisons, mere skin contact can be lethal;
### others are lethal when breathed into the lungs in microscopic
### amounts. To determine if a chemical will be officially called a poison,
### researchers often use the “LD50” test: If 50 milligrams of the
### substance for every kilogram of an animal's body weight results in
### the death of 50% of test animals, the chemical is a poison. But there
### are problems with such tests, and toxicity remains a very individual
### concept.

### toxicology
### A science that deals with poisons and
### their effect.
### • At medical school he had specialized in toxicology, hoping
### eventually to find work in a crime laboratory.
### Even though most of us are aware of toxicology primarily from crime
### shows on TV, toxicologists actually do most of their work in other
### fields. Many are employed by drug companies, others by chemical
### companies. Many work for the government, making sure the public
### is being kept safe from environmental poisons in the water, soil, and
### air, as well as unhealthy substances in our food and drugs. These
### issues often have to do with quantity; questions about how much of
### some substance should be considered dangerous, whether in the air
### or in a soft drink, may be left to toxicologists. But occasionally a
### toxicology task may be more exciting: for instance, discovering that
### what looked like an ordinary heart attack was actually brought on by
### a hypodermic injection of a paralyzing muscle relaxant.

### neurotoxin
### A poisonous protein that acts on the
### nervous system.
### • From her blurred vision, slurred speech, and muscle weakness,
### doctors realized she had encountered a neurotoxin, and they
### suspected botulism.
### The nervous system is almost all-powerful in the body: all five
### senses depend on it, as do breathing, digestion, and the heart. So
### it's an obvious target for poisons, and neurotoxins have developed
### as weapons in many animals, including snakes, bees, and spiders.
### Some wasps use a neurotoxin to paralyze their prey so that it can be
### stored alive to be eaten later. Snake venom is often neurotoxic (as in
### cobras and coral snakes, for example), though it may instead be
### hemotoxic (as in rattlesnakes and coppermouths), operating on the
### circulatory system. Artificial neurotoxins, called nerve agents, have
### been developed by scientists as means of chemical warfare; luckily,
### few have ever been used.

### TEN/TENU
### comes from the Latin tenuis, meaning “thin.” So to
### extend something is to stretch it, and lots of things get thin when
### they're stretched. The ten- root is even seen in pretend, which once
### meant to stretch something out above or in front; that something
### came to be a claim that you were something that you actually
### weren't.

### tenuous
### Having little substance or strength; flimsy,
### weak.
### • It's a rather tenuous theory, and the evidence supporting it has
### been questioned by several researchers.
### Something tenuous has been stretched thin and might break at any
### time. A person with a tenuous hold on his sanity should be watched
### carefully. If a business is only tenuously surviving, it will probably go
### bankrupt in the next recession. If there seems to be only a tenuous
### connection between two crimes, it means the investigators have
### more work to do.

### attenuated
### Thinned or weakened.
### • The smallpox shot is an injection of the virus in an attenuated form
### too weak to produce an actual case of smallpox.
### A friendship can become attenuated if neither person bothers to
### keep in touch. Radio waves can become attenuated by the shape of
### the landscape, by foliage, by atmospheric conditions, and simply by
### distance. Factory workers and rock musicians often use noise-
### attenuating ear plugs to save their hearing. To attenuate something
### isn't to stop it, just to tone it down.

### extenuating
### Partially excusing or justifying.
### • A good college rarely accepts someone who has dropped out of
### high school twice, but in his case there were extenuating
### circumstances, including the death of both parents.
### Extenuating is almost always used today before “circumstances.”
### Extenuating circumstances are an important concept in the law. If
### you steal to feed your children, you're naturally less guilty than
### someone who steals just to get richer; if you kill someone in self-
### defense, that's obviously an extenuating circumstance that makes
### your act different from murder. Juries will usually consider
### extenuating circumstances (even when they're instructed not to),
### and most judges will listen carefully to an argument about
### extenuating circumstances as well. And they work outside of the
### courtroom as well; if you miss your daughter's performance in the
### middle-school pageant, she may forgive you if it was because you
### had to race Tigger to the vet's emergency room.

### distended
### Stretched or bulging out in all directions;
### swelled.
### • All the children's bellies were distended, undoubtedly because of
### inadequate nutrition or parasites.
### Before giving you a shot, the nurse may wrap a rubber tube around
### your upper arm to distend the veins. When the heart isn't pumping
### properly, the skin of the feet and ankles may become distended. A
### doctor who notices that an internal organ has become distended will
### always want to find out the cause. As you can see, distended tends
### to be a medical term.

### TECHNI/TECHNO
### comes from the Greek techne, meaning “art,
### craft, skill,” and shows up in dozens of English words. Some, such as
### technical, technology, and technique, have long been familiar.
### Others, such as techno-thriller, were only coined in the current
### computer age, which has also seen the new cut-down terms techno
### (for techno-pop, the electronic dance music) and tech (for technician
### or technology).

### technocrat
### A scientist or technical expert with power
### in politics or industry.
### • The new president, a great fan of science, had surrounded himself
### with an impressive team of technocrats.
### In 1919 W. H. Smyth coined the term technocracy to mean basically
### “management of society by technical experts.” Technocracy grew
### into a movement during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when
### politicians and financial institutions were being blamed for the
### economic disaster, and fans of technocracy claimed that letting
### technical experts manage the country would be a great
### improvement. (They also suggested that dollars could be replaced
### by “energy certificates” representing energy units called ergs.) Today
### technocrat and technocratic are still popular words for experts with a
### highly rational and scientific approach to public policy issues. But
### these experts aren't always the best politicians, and when a terrific
### technological solution to a problem is opposed by a powerful group
### or industry, lawmakers find it easier to just ignore it.

### technophobe
### One who fears or dislikes advanced
### technology or complex devices and especially computers.
### • The new employee was a middle-aged technophobe, who seemed
### startled every time a new page popped up on her computer screen.
### The condition known as technophobia got its name around 1965
### (though its synonym Luddite had been around for a long time), and
### since then we've been flooded with electronic gadgetry. But even
### today few people actually understand any electrical technology more
### complicated than a lightbulb, so there's still plenty of technophobia
### around. And it isn't limited to computer users. The explosion of the
### atomic bomb made technophobes out of millions of people; and
### since human-caused climate change has been a result of technology,
### it's not surprising that it too has produced a technophobic response.
### But if technology turns out to be part of a solution, maybe that will
### change.

### technophile
### One who loves technology.
### • Back in my day, the high-school technophiles subscribed to Popular
### Mechanics, built ham radios, and were always taking apart the
### engines of their clunkers.
### The word technophile came along soon after technophobe, which
### seemed to need an antonym. Its own synonyms include geek,
### gearhead, and propeller-head (for the characters in 1950s comic
### books who wore propeller beanies to indicate that they were sci-fi
### fans). Even before American inventors began amazing the world with
### their “Yankee ingenuity” in the 19th century, most Americans could
### be described as technology lovers. Today, American technophilia may
### be seen most vividly when a new version of a popular video game
### sells millions of copies to young buyers on the day of its release.

### pyrotechnic
### Of or relating to fireworks.
### • Her astonishing, pyrotechnic performance in the concerto left the
### audience dazed.
### You've read about funeral pyres, and you may even have survived a
### pyromaniac (“insane fire-starting”) stage in your youth, so you might
### have guessed that pyr means “fire” in Greek. Pyrotechnic refers
### literally to fireworks, but always seems to be used for something else
### —something just as exciting, explosive, dazzling, sparkling, or
### brilliant. The performances of sports stars and dancers are often
### described as pyrotechnic, and a critic may describe the pyrotechnics
### of a rock guitarist's licks or a film's camerawork. A pyrotechnic
### performance is always impressive, but the word occasionally
### suggests something more like “flashy” or “flamboyant.”

### LONG
### comes from Latin longus, which, as you might guess, means
### “long.” The English word long shows up in many compound terms
### such as long-suffering (“patiently enduring lasting offense or
### hardship”) and long-winded (“boringly long in speaking or writing”),
### but the long- root also sometimes shows up less obviously. To
### prolong something is to lengthen it, for example, and a chaise
### longue (not lounge!) is “a long reclining chair.”

### longitude
### Distance measured by degrees or time east
### or west from the prime meridian.
### • Checking the longitude, she was surprised to see that the tip of
### South America is actually east of New York City.
### The imaginary (but very important) lines of longitude run from the
### North Pole to the South Pole. Each is identified by the number of
### degrees it lies east or west of the so-called prime meridian in
### Greenwich, England (part of London). A circle is divided into 360°;
### so, for example, the longitude of the Egyptian city of Cairo is about
### 31°E—that is, about 31° east of London. The “long” sense of the
### root may be easier to see in some uses of the adjective longitudinal:
### A longitudinal study is a research study that follows its subjects over
### many long years, and a longitudinal engine is one that drives a
### crankshaft that runs lengthwise under a vehicle (as in rear-wheel-
### drive cars) rather than crosswise.

### elongate
### (1) To extend the length of; stretch. (2) To
### grow in length.
### • When mammals gained the ability to fly, it wasn't by means of
### feathered wings; instead, over thousands of years the digits of their
### “hands” elongated and a web formed between them.
### Elongate is often found in scientific writing, but the adjective
### elongated is more common, and frequently used to describe body
### parts in discussions of anatomy. This was even the case when the
### superhero Elongated Man made his appearance back in 1960. But
### some other characters with the same powers—Plastic Man, Elastic
### Lad, and Mr. Fantastic—ended up having longer careers.

### longueur
### A dull and boring portion, as of a book.
### • She tells me the book is extremely rewarding, in spite of some
### longueurs during which she occasionally drops off to sleep.
### Longueur comes straight from French, a language based on Latin.
### When we borrow a foreign word, it's usually because English doesn't
### have a really good synonym, which is the case here. Longueur is
### used mostly when talking about books, but also when describing
### lectures and speeches. Like certain other French words, longueur
### tends to be used mainly by critics and professors—but lots of us who
### aren't either could find plenty of use for it too.

### oblong
### Longer in one direction than in the other.
### • Their apartment was awkwardly oblong, with a long skinny hall
### running past the cramped rooms.
### Oblong is a general but useful term for describing the shape of
### things such as leaves. There's no such thing as an oblong circle,
### since a stretched circle has to be called an oval, and any rectangle
### that isn't square is oblong, at least if it's lying on its side (such
### rectangles can actually be called oblongs). Pills are generally oblong
### rather than round, to slide down the throat more easily. An oblong
### table will often fit a living space better than a square or round one
### with the same area. And people are always buried in oblong boxes.

### IDIO
### comes from the Greek idios, meaning “one's own” or “private.”
### In Latin this root led to the word idiota, meaning “ignorant person”—
### that is, a person who doesn't take in knowledge from outside
### himself. And that led to a familiar English word that gets used too
### often, usually to describe people who aren't ignorant at all.

### idiom
### An expression that cannot be understood from the
### meanings of its separate words but must be learned as a whole.
### • As a teacher of foreign students, you can't use idioms like “Beats
### me!” and “Don't jump the gun” in class unless you want to confuse
### everyone.
### If you had never heard someone say “We're on the same page,”
### would you have understood that they weren't talking about a book?
### And the first time someone said he'd “ride shotgun,” did you wonder
### where the gun was? A modern English-speaker knows thousands of
### idioms, and uses many every day. Idioms can be completely ordinary
### (“first off,” “the other day,” “make a point of,” “What's up?”) or more
### colorful (“asleep at the wheel,” “bite the bullet,” “knuckle sandwich”).
### A particular type of idiom, called a phrasal verb , consists of a verb
### followed by an adverb or preposition (or sometimes both); in make
### over, make out, and make up, for instance, notice how the meanings
### have nothing to do with the usual meanings of over, out, and up.

### idiomatic
### In a manner conforming to the particular
### forms of a language.
### • The instructions for assembling the TV probably sounded fine in
### the original Chinese but weren't exactly written in idiomatic English.
### The speech and writing of a native-born English-speaker may seem
### crude, uneducated, and illiterate, but will almost always be idiomatic
### —that is, a native speaker always sounds like a native speaker. For a
### language learner, speaking and writing idiomatically in another
### language is the greatest challenge. Even highly educated foreign
### learners—professors, scientists, doctors, etc.—rarely succeed in
### mastering the kind of idiomatic English spoken by an American 7th-
### grader.

### idiosyncrasy
### An individual peculiarity of a
### person's behavior or thinking.
### • Mr. Kempthorne, whose idiosyncrasies are well known to most of
### us, has recently begun walking around town talking to two ferrets he
### carries on his shoulders.
### Idiosyncrasies are almost always regarded as harmless. So, for
### example, filling your house with guns and Nazi posters might be
### called something stronger than idiosyncratic. But if you always
### arrange your Gummi candies in table form by color and type, then
### eat them in a special order starting with the pterodactyls (purple
### ones must die first!), you might qualify. Harmless though your
### strange habits might be, they may not be the kind of thing you'd tell
### people
### about; most
### Americans
### are
### careful to
### hide
### their
### idiosyncrasies, since our culture doesn't seem to value odd behavior.
### The British, however, are generally fond of their eccentrics, and
### English villages seem to be filled with them. By the way, few words
### are harder to spell than idiosyncrasy—be careful.

### idiopathic
### Arising spontaneously or from an
### obscure or unknown cause.
### • After her doctor hemmed and hawed and finally described her
### condition as “idiopathic,” she realized she needed a second opinion.
### Words with the -pathy suffix generally name a disease or condition
### (see
### PATH
### ), so you might think idiopathic should describe a disease
### or condition that's unique to an individual. But the word is actually
### generally used to describe any medical condition that no one has yet
### figured out. Most facial tics are called idiopathic by doctors, since no
### cause can be found. Other well-known conditions, including chronic
### fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia, still
### perplex the medical community. And even though doctors expect
### that the causes of all of them will eventually be found, and that
### those causes will turn out to be the same for hundreds of thousands
### of people, the conditions are still called idiopathic.

### AER/AERO
### comes from the Greek word for “air.” The aerospace
### industry manufactures vehicles that travel through the atmosphere
### and beyond into space. Aerodynamic designs move through the air
### with maximum speed. And aerophobia is the technical name for
### what we usually just call fear of flying.

### aerial
### (1) Performed in the air. (2) Performed using an
### airplane.
### • They're doing an aerial survey of the whale population, which
### involves scanning the ocean's surface from an airplane.
### Shakespeare himself may have coined this word, in Othello, and
### later he gave the name Ariel to the famous air-spirit character in The
### Tempest. An aerialist is an acrobat who performs high above the
### audience. In painting, aerial perspective is the way an artist creates
### the illusion that a mountain or city is far away (something that early
### painters only slowly learned how to do), usually by making it slightly
### misty and bluish gray—as if seen through miles of air. An aerial work
### platform, or “cherry picker,” supports a worker at a high elevation on
### the end of a crane. And aerial itself can be used as a noun, meaning
### a TV antenna, a forward pass in football, or a high-flying stunt
### performed by a skateboarder or snowboarder.

### aerate
### To supply with air or oxygen.
### • The garden soil was well aerated, since they had recently plowed
### in all the compost and manure and even added a box of
### earthworms.
### Faucet aerators and aerating showerheads can be easily installed by
### homeowners to cut water (and especially hot water) use by as much
### as 50%. A lawn aerator removes little plugs of soil in order to let air
### deep into the soil, greatly improving the quality of soil that may have
### gotten too compacted. And a pond aerator, such as a fountain, is a
### necessity for an ornamental pond with no stream feeding it, since
### oxygen in the water is necessary to prevent the growth of algae and
### allow fish to live.

### aerobic
### (1) Living or occurring only in the presence of
### oxygen. (2) Involving or increasing oxygen consumption.
### • Trainers measure a person's aerobic capacity by means of the VO
2
### max (“maximum volume of oxygen”) test.
### Aerobic exercise is exercise that takes an extended amount of time—
### usually ten minutes or more—but is usually performed at only
### moderate intensity. Running, swimming, bicycling, and cross-country
### skiing are classic aerobic exercises. In 1968 a best-selling book
### called Aerobics introduced a system of exercise for increasing the
### body's ability to take in and use oxygen, and today aerobics classes,
### often mimicking such outdoor exercise as running and bicycling, take
### place every afternoon in thousands of gyms and YMCAs across the
### country. Aerobic exercise particularly strengthens the heart and
### lungs, but usually has many other good effects as well. Aerobic
### bacteria, which need oxygen to live, are essential for breaking down
### living matter so that it returns to the soil. They include the famous
### intestinal E. coli, as well as the staph and strep bacteria that can
### make a visit to the hospital risky.

### anaerobic
### (1) Living or occurring in the absence of
### oxygen. (2) Relating to activity in which the body works temporarily
### with inadequate oxygen.
### • He's never run a mile in his life, and everything he does at the gym
### is anaerobic.
### In Greek, the prefix a- or an- means “not” or “without,” and bios
### means “life.” Anaerobic sports and exercise, such as gymnastics,
### weight lifting, and sprinting, are of high intensity but short duration,
### so they don't involve much oxygen intake. Anaerobic exercise
### triggers a different type of cell activity from aerobic exercise. As a
### result, it doesn't do much for your heart and lungs and it doesn't
### burn off fat; what it does do is build muscle. Anaerobic bacteria are
### bacteria that live without oxygen. They're responsible for several
### nasty conditions, including tetanus, gangrene, botulism, and food
### poisoning. They often live in deep wounds, so a bad dog bite—or,
### even worse, a human bite—can be dangerous, since the mouth is
### full of anaerobic bacteria. But most anaerobic bacteria are harmless,
### and many are essential to our lives.

### CAD
### comes from the Latin verb cadere, “to fall.” Thus, a cascade is
### usually a waterfall, but sometimes a flood of something else that
### seems to pour on top of you: a cascade of new problems, a cascade
### of honors, and so on.

### cadaver
### A dead body, especially one that is to be
### dissected; a corpse.
### • The cadaver she was given to work on, from the Manhattan
### morgue, was that of an unclaimed homeless woman.
### Since a corpse is a body that has “fallen down dead,” the root cad-
### seems at home here. For most of us, cadaver has an impersonal
### sound, and indeed the word is often used for a body whose identity
### isn't important: most medical students probably don't spend much
### time wondering who they're dissecting. Someone with cadaverous
### features looks like a corpse before he or she is dead.

### decadent
### Marked by decay or decline, especially in
### morals.
### • The French empire may have been at its most decadent just before
### the French Revolution.
### To be decadent is to be in the process of decay, so a powerful nation
### may be said to be in a decadent stage if its power is fading. But the
### word is more often used to speak of moral decay. Ever since the
### Roman empire, we've tended to link Rome's fall to the moral decay
### of its ruling class, who indulged in extreme luxuries and
### unwholesome pleasures while providing the public with cruel
### spectacles such as the slaughter of the gladiators. But not everyone
### agrees on what moral decadence looks like (or even how it might
### have hastened the fall of Rome), though most people think it
### involves too many sensual pleasures—as, for instance, among the
### French and English poets and artists of the 1880s and '90s called the
### Decadents. These days, for some reason, people have decided
### decadent is the way to describe rich chocolate cakes.

### cadence
### (1) The close of a musical phrase, especially
### one that moves to a harmonic point of rest. (2) The rhythmic flow of
### sound in language.
### • As the piano came to a cadence, the singer ascended to a beautiful
### high note, which she held for several seconds until the piano came
### in again in a new key.
### Most of us hear the ending of a piece of music as a fall to a resting
### place, even if the melody ends on a high note. And that's the way
### endings were being heard way back in the 16th century, when
### cadence first began to be used in English for musical endings. Most
### cadences are harmonic “formulas” (standard harmonic patterns that
### we've all heard thousands of times) and we don't expect them to be
### original; so whether you're consciously aware of it or not, a cadential
### passage is usually quite recognizable. When cadence means “speech
### rhythm,” its cad- root refers to the way the accents “fall.”

### cadenza
### A virtuosic flourish or extended passage by a
### soloist, often improvised, that occurs shortly before the end of a
### piece or movement.
### • Each of her arias was greeted with greater applause, but it was the
### brilliant improvised cadenza of her final number that brought down
### the house.
### A concerto is a large piece for an instrumental soloist (usually
### playing piano or violin) and orchestra. Concertos are often extremely
### demanding for the soloist, but the most difficult part of all may be
### the cadenza, when the orchestra drops out completely, leaving the
### soloist to dazzle the audience with a set of flourishes, often
### completely original, right before a movement ends. Cadenzas are
### also heard in many vocal arias, especially those of the 18th century.
### The word, borrowed from Italian, originally meant “cadence”; thus,
### the cadenza, even if it lasts for a couple of minutes, is essentially a
### decoration of the final important harmonic cadence of the piece.

### TRIB
### comes from the Latin tribuere, meaning “to give” or “to pay.”
### So a group that distributes food passes it out to those in need, and
### when you contribute to the group you give your money or energy to
### it.

### tribute
### (1) Something (such as a gift or speech) that is
### given or performed to show appreciation, respect, or affection. (2)
### Something that proves the good quality or effectiveness of
### something.
### • Near the end of his speech, he paid tribute to the two pioneers in
### the field who were in the audience.
### Tribute originally took the form of things given from a weaker group
### to the dominant power of a region—a bit like the “protection money”
### the Mafia gets from small businesses after making them offers they
### can't refuse, though the older form of tribute actually did buy the
### weaker group some protection from enemy forces. Tribute could
### come in the form of valuables, cattle, or even produce, and might
### include the loan of warriors to strengthen the ruler's army. But when
### we “pay tribute” today, it's generally in the form of praise. And when
### we say, for instance, that a successful school “is a tribute to” the
### vision of its founder, we mean that its success is itself a form of
### praise for the person who founded it. And a “tribute band” is a rock
### group intended to honor a great band of the past.

### tributary
### A stream flowing into a larger stream or a
### lake.
### • The entire expedition had perished of fever attempting to reach
### the source of one of the Amazon's great tributaries.
### A tributary was originally a person or state that owed tribute to a
### more powerful person or state. Ancient China, for instance, had
### dozens of tributary states, and the emperor would receive elephants
### from Siam or young girls from Korea as tribute. Just as a smaller
### power gave some of its wealth to a larger power, a small river
### contributes its waters to a larger one. A tributary can be a tiny
### stream, but some are immense rivers. The Missouri River, for
### example, could be called a tributary to the Mississippi, even though
### it's about 2,500 miles long and receives hundreds of tributaries itself.

### attribute
### (1) To explain by indicating a cause. (2) To
### regard as likely to be a quality of a person or thing.
### • He attributed his long life to a good sense of humor and a glass of
### wine with lunch and dinner every day.
### Attribute means something rather similar to “pay tribute.” So, for
### example, an award winner who pays tribute to an inspiring professor
### is, in a sense, attributing her success to the professor. Though if you
### attribute your fear of dogs to an incident in your childhood, you're
### not exactly praising the nasty dog that bit you way back when. The
### second sense of attribute is slightly different: If you attribute bad
### motives to a politician, it means you think he or she is doing things
### for the wrong reasons (even if you don't have any proof). When
### attribute is accented on its first syllable, it's being used as a noun,
### usually as a synonym for quality. So, for instance, you may believe
### that an even temper is an attribute of the best presidents, or that
### cheerfulness is your spouse's best attribute.

### retribution
### Something given in payment for a
### wrong; punishment.
### • The victims' families have been clamoring for retribution,
### sometimes even interrupting the trial proceedings.
### With its prefix re-, meaning “back,” retribution means literally
### “payback.” And indeed we usually use it when talking about personal
### revenge, whether it's retribution for an insult in a high-school
### corridor or retribution for a guerrilla attack on a government
### building. But retribution isn't always so personal: God takes “divine
### retribution” on humans several times in the Old Testament,
### especially in the great Flood that wipes out almost the entire human
### race. And retribution for criminal acts, usually in the form of a prison
### sentence, is taken by the state, not the victims.

## Words from Mythology and History
### halcyon
### (1) Calm and peaceful. (2) Happy and
### successful.
### • She looks back fondly on those halcyon childhood days when she
### and her sisters seemed to inhabit a magical world where it was
### always summer.
### For the Greeks, the halcyon was a bird (probably the kingfisher) that
### was believed to nest on the Mediterranean Sea around the beginning
### of winter, and had the power to quiet the rough December waters
### around Sicily for about two weeks—the “halcyon days.” Thus the
### adjective halcyon came to mean calm and serene. Today people
### especially use it to describe a golden time in their past.

### meander
### (1) To follow a winding course. (2) To
### wander slowly without a specific purpose or direction.
### • A little-used trail meanders through the mountains, crossed by
### cowpaths onto which hikers often stray and get lost.
### Now and then, geography contributes an ordinary word to the
### language. The Greek word maiandros came from the Maiandros
### River (now the Menderes River) in western Turkey, which rises in the
### mountains and flows 240 miles into the Aegean Sea. Meandering is a
### natural tendency especially in slow-moving rivers on flat ground with
### fine-grained sand, and the Maiandros was well known for its many
### windings and wanderings. Roads and trails, like rivers, can be said to
### meander, but so can relaxed music, lazy writing, and idle thoughts.

### oedipal
### Relating to an intense emotional relationship
### with one's mother and conflict with one's father.
### • Already on her first visit she sensed a tense oedipal situation, with
### her boyfriend and his father barely getting through dinner without
### coming to blows.
### In Greek mythology, the king of Thebes, in response to a dreadful
### prophecy, abandoned his infant son Oedipus, who was then brought
### up by shepherds. Grown to manhood, Oedipus slew his father
### almost accidentally, not recognizing him, and then married his
### mother. When the shameful truth was discovered, the mother
### committed suicide and Oedipus blinded himself and went into exile.
### The psychiatrist Sigmund Freud invented the term Oedipus complex
### to mean a sexual desire that a child normally feels toward the parent
### of the opposite sex, along with jealous feelings toward the parent of
### the same sex. In Freud's theory (not accepted by everyone today),
### lingering oedipal feelings are an essential source of adult personality
### disorder, and can result in choosing a spouse who closely resembles
### your father or mother.

### ostracize
### To exclude someone from a group by
### common consent .
### • Back in the 1950s she had been ostracized by her fellow country-
### club members for her radical political beliefs.
### In the ancient democracy of Athens, citizens were permitted to vote
### once a year to exile anyone who they thought might pose a problem
### to the city-state. The man with the most votes was banished for ten
### years, even if no one had ever made a single charge against him.
### Voting was done on ostraka—bits of broken pottery, the Greek
### equivalent of scrap paper—and the process was known as
### ostrakizein. Today the most common kind of ostracism is exclusion
### from a social group. It can be especially painful in school: no more
### sleepovers, no more party invitations, just lots of whispering behind
### your back.

### paean
### (1) A song of joy, praise, tribute, or triumph. (2) A
### work that praises or honors its subject.
### • At his retirement party, the beloved president was treated to
### paeans from friends and employees to his years at the head of the
### company.
### Originally in ancient Greece, a paian was a choral hymn to Apollo as
### the god of healing. More generally, it could be a hymn of
### thanksgiving, as when, in Homer's Iliad, the followers of Achilles sing
### a paean on the death of his enemy Hector. Paeans could be sung at
### banquets, at public funerals, to armies departing for battle and fleets
### leaving the harbor, and in celebrations of military victories.

### philippic
### A speech full of bitter condemnation; a tirade.
### • Every few days he launches another philippic against teenagers:
### their ridiculous clothes, their abominable manners, their ghastly
### music.
### In 351–350 B.C., the great Greek orator Demosthenes delivered a
### series of speeches against King Philip II of Macedon, the so-called
### philippikoi logoi (“speeches regarding Philip”). Three centuries later,
### in 44–43 B.C., the great Roman orator Cicero delivered a series of
### speeches against Mark Antony, which soon became known as the
### philippica or orationes philippicae, since they were modeled on
### Demosthenes' attacks. Splendid though both men's speeches were,
### Demosthenes was eventually exiled by the Macedonians, and Cicero
### was executed at Mark Antony's orders.

### satyr
### A man with a strong desire for many women.
### • Still drinking and womanizing at the age of 70, he likes to think of
### himself as a satyr rather than an old goat.
### Satyrs, the minor forest gods of Greek mythology, had the face,
### torso, and arms of a man, the ears and tail of a goat, and two
### goatlike legs. Fond of the pleasures associated with Dionysus (or
### Bacchus), the god of wine, they were full of playful and sometimes
### violent energies, and spent much of their time chasing the beautiful
### nature spirits known as nymphs. Satyrs show up over and over in
### ancient art. The Greek god Pan, with his reed pipes and mischievous
### delight in life, had the appearance and character of a satyr but
### greater powers. Notice how satyr is pronounced; it's quite different
### from satire.

### zealot
### A fanatical supporter.
### • My girlfriend's father is a religious zealot, so I always find excuses
### not to have dinner at their house.
### In the 1st century A.D., a fanatical sect arose in Judaea to oppose
### the Roman domination of Palestine. Known as the Zealots, they
### fought their most famous battle at the great fortress of Masada,
### where 1,000 defenders took their own lives just as the Romans were
### about to storm the fort. Over the years, zealot came to mean
### anyone who is passionately devoted to a cause. The adjective
### zealous may describe someone who's merely dedicated and
### energetic (“a zealous investigator,” “zealous about combating
### inflation,” etc.). But zealot (like its synonym fanatic) and zealotry
### (like its synonym fanaticism) are used disapprovingly—even while
### Jews everywhere still honor the memory of those who died at
### Masada.
