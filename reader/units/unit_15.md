### TERM/TERMIN
### comes from the Latin verb terminare, “to limit,
### bound, or set limits to,” and the noun terminus, “limit or boundary.”
### In English, those boundaries or limits tend to be final. A term goes
### on for a given amount of time and then ends, and to terminate a
### sentence or a meeting or a ballgame means to end it.

### terminal
### (1) Forming or relating to an end or limit. (2)
### Fatal.
### • She knows she's in the late stages of a terminal illness, and has
### already drawn up a will.
### A terminal disease ends in death. If you're terminally bored, you're
### “bored to death.” For many students, a high-school diploma is their
### terminal degree (others finish college before terminating their
### education). A bus or train terminal is the endpoint of the line. A
### computer terminal was originally the endpoint of a line connecting to
### a central computer. A terminal ornament may mark the end of a
### building, and terminal punctuation ends this sentence.

### indeterminate
### Not precisely determined;
### vague.
### • The police are looking for a tall white bearded man of
### indeterminate age who should be considered armed and dangerous.
### When you determine something, you decide on what it is, which
### means you put limits or boundaries on its identity. So something
### indeterminate lacks identifying limits. A mutt is usually the product
### of indeterminate breeding, since at least the father's identity is
### generally a mystery. A painting of indeterminate origins is normally
### less valued than one with the painter's name on it. And if
### negotiations are left in an indeterminate state, nothing has been
### decided.

### interminable
### Having or seeming to have no
### end; tiresomely drawn out.
### • The preacher was making another of his interminable pleas for
### money, so she snapped off the TV.
### Nothing is literally endless, except maybe the universe and time
### itself, so interminable as we use it is always an exaggeration. On an
### unlucky day you might sit through an interminable meeting, have an
### interminable drive home in heavy traffic, and watch an interminable
### film—all in less than 24 hours.

### terminus
### (1) The end of a travel route (such as a rail
### or bus line), or the station at the end of a route. (2) An extreme
### point; tip.
### • They've been tracking the terminus of the glacier for 20 years, in
### which time it has retreated 500 yards.
### This word comes straight from Latin. In the Roman empire, a
### terminus was a boundary stone, and all boundary stones had a
### minor god associated with them, whose name was Terminus.
### Terminus was a kind of keeper of the peace, since wherever there
### was a terminus there could be no arguments about where your
### property ended and your neighbor's property began. So Terminus
### even had his own festival, the Terminalia, when images of the god
### were draped with flower garlands. Today the word shows up in all
### kinds of places, including in the name of numerous hotels worldwide
### built near a city's railway terminus.

### GEO
### comes from the Greek word for “Earth.” Geography is the
### science that deals with features of the Earth's surface. Geologists
### study rocks and soil to learn about the Earth's history and resources.
### Geometry was originally about measuring portions of the Earth's
### surface, probably originally in order to determine where the
### boundaries of Egyptians' farms lay after the annual flooding by the
### Nile River.

### geocentric
### Having or relating to the Earth as the
### center.
### • He claims that, if you aren't a scientist, your consciousness is
### mostly geocentric for your entire life.
### The idea that the Earth is the center of the universe and that the
### sun revolves around it is an ancient one, probably dating back to the
### earliest humans. Not until 1543 did the Polish astronomer
### Copernicus publish his calculations proving that the Earth actually
### revolves around the sun, thus replacing the geocentric model with a
### heliocentric model (from Helios, the Greek god of the sun). But
### geocentrism remains central to various religious sects around the
### world, and still today one in five adult Americans believes the sun
### revolves around the Earth.

### geophysics
### The science that deals with the physical
### processes and phenomena occurring especially in the Earth and in its
### vicinity.
### • Located in the heart of oil and gas country, the university offers a
### degree in geophysics and many of its graduates go straight to work
### for the oil and gas industry.
### Geophysics applies the principles of physics to the study of the
### Earth. It deals with such things as the movement of the Earth's crust
### and the temperatures of its interior. Another subject is the behavior
### of the still-mysterious geomagnetic field. Some geophysicists seek
### out deposits of ores or petroleum; others specialize in earthquakes;
### still others study the water beneath the Earth's surface, where it
### collects and how it flows.

### geostationary
### Being or having an orbit such
### that a satellite remains in a fixed position above the Earth, especially
### having such an orbit above the equator.
### • It was the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke who first
### conceived of a set of geostationary satellites as a means of
### worldwide communication.
### We don't give much thought to geostationary satellites, but many of
### us rely on them daily. Anyone who watches satellite TV or listens to
### satellite radio is dependent on them; the weather photos you see on
### TV are taken from geostationary satellites; and military information
### gathering via satellite goes on quietly day after day. (Though the
### satellites that provide GPS service for your car or cell phone actually
### aren't geostationary, since they orbit the Earth twice a day.) By 2009
### there were about 300 geostationary satellites in operation, all of
### them moving at an altitude of about 22,000 miles. Since they hover
### above the same spot on Earth, your receiving dish or antenna
### doesn't have to turn in order to track them.

### geothermal
### Of, relating to, or using the natural
### heat produced inside the Earth.
### • Geothermal power plants convert underground water or steam to
### electricity.
### Geothermal comes partly from the Greek thermos, “hot” (see
### THERM/THERMO
### ). Most geothermal electricity is provided by power
### plants situated in areas where there is significant activity of the
### Earth's great tectonic plates—often the same areas where volcanoes
### are found. But hot water from deep underground may be used by
### cities far from volcanoes to heat buildings or sidewalks. And a newer
### source of geothermal energy relies on a less dramatic kind of heat:
### Individual homeowners can now install heat pumps that take
### advantage of the 50°-60° temperature of the soil near the surface to
### provide heating in cold weather (and air-conditioning in the warm
### months). These very small-scale geothermal systems may eventually
### supply more useful energy than the large power plants.

### Answers

### SPHER
### comes from the Greek word for “ball.” A ball is itself a
### sphere, as is the ball that we call Earth. So is the atmosphere, and
### so are several other invisible “spheres” that encircle the Earth.

### spherical
### Relating to a sphere; shaped like a sphere or
### one of its segments.
### • The girls agreed that the spacecraft had been deep blue and
### perfectly spherical, and that its alien passengers had resembled
### large praying mantises.
### Something spherical is like a sphere in being round, or more or less
### round, in three dimensions. Apples and oranges are both spherical,
### for example, even though they're never perfectly round. A spheroid
### has a roughly spherical shape; so an asteroid, for instance, is often
### spheroidal—fairly round, but lumpy.

### stratosphere
### (1) The part of the earth's atmosphere
### that extends from about seven to about 30 miles above the surface.
### (2) A very high or the highest region.
### • In the celebrity stratosphere she now occupied, a fee of 12 million
### dollars per film was a reasonable rate.
### The stratosphere (strato- simply means “layer” or “level”) lies above
### the earth's weather and mostly changes very little. It contains the
### ozone layer, which shields us from the sun's ultraviolet radiation
### except where it's been harmed by manmade chemicals. The levels of
### the atmosphere are marked particularly by their temperatures;
### stratospheric temperatures rise only to around 32°—very moderate
### considering that temperatures in the troposphere below may
### descend to about -70° and those in the ionosphere above may rise
### to 1000°.

### biosphere
### (1) The part of the world in which life can
### exist. (2) Living things and their environment.
### • The moon has no biosphere, so an artificial one would have to be
### constructed for any long-term stay.
### The lithosphere is the solid surface of the earth (lith- meaning
### “rock”); the hydrosphere is the earth's water (hydro- means
### “water”), including the clouds and water vapor in the air; and the
### atmosphere is the earth's air (atmos- meaning “vapor”). The term
### biosphere can include all of these, along with the 10 million species
### of living things they contain. The biosphere recycles its air, water,
### organisms, and minerals constantly to maintain an amazingly
### balanced state; human beings should probably do their best to
### imitate it. Though the word has a new sound to it, it was first used
### over a hundred years ago.

### hemisphere
### Half a sphere, especially half the global
### sphere as divided by the equator or a meridian.
### • A sailor who crosses the equator from the northern to the southern
### hemisphere for the first time is traditionally given a special initiation.
### Hemisphere includes the prefix hemi-, meaning “half.” The northern
### and southern hemispheres are divided by the equator, the circle
### halfway between Earth's two poles. The eastern and western
### hemispheres aren't divided so exactly, since there are no poles in the
### Earth's east-west dimension. Often the dividing line is said to be the
### “prime meridian”—the imaginary north-south line that runs through
### Greenwich, England, from which all longitude is calculated (itself
### being the 0° meridian). But for simplicity's sake, the eastern
### hemisphere is often said to include all of Europe, Africa, Australia,
### and Asia, while the western hemisphere contains North and South
### America and a great deal of ocean.

### VERT
### comes from the Latin verb vertere, meaning “to turn” or “to
### turn around.” Vertigo is the dizziness that makes it seem as if
### everything is turning around you. And an advertisement turns your
### attention to a product or service.

### divert
### (1) To turn from one purpose or course to another.
### (2) To give pleasure to by distracting from burdens or distress.
### • The farmers had successfully diverted some of the river's water to
### irrigate their crops during the drought.
### The Roman circus was used to provide diversion for its citizens—and
### sometimes to divert their attention from the government's failings as
### well. The diversion was often in the form of a fight—men pitted
### against lions, bears, or each other—and the audience was sure to
### see blood and death. A diverting evening these days might instead
### include watching the same kind of mayhem on a movie screen.

### converter
### A device that changes something (such as
### radio signals, radio frequencies, or data) from one form to another.
### • She was so indifferent to television that she hadn't even bought a
### converter, and her old TV sat there useless until she finally lugged it
### down to the recycling center.
### Converters come in many forms. Travelers to foreign countries who
### bring along their electric razors or hair dryers always pack a small
### electric converter, which can change direct current to alternating
### current or vice versa. In 2009 millions of Americans bought digital-
### analog converters, small box-shaped devices that change the new
### broadcast digital signal to the analog signal that older TV sets were
### made to receive. A catalytic converter is the pollution-control device
### attached to your car's exhaust system that converts pollutants such
### as carbon monoxide into harmless form.

### avert
### (1) To turn (your eyes or gaze) away or aside. (2) To
### avoid or prevent.
### • General Camacho's announcement of lower food prices averted an
### immediate worker's revolt.
### Sensitive people avert their eyes from gory accidents and scenes of
### disaster. But the accident or disaster might itself have been averted
### if someone had been alert enough. Negotiators may avert a strike by
### all-night talks. In the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, it seemed that
### nuclear catastrophe was barely averted. Aversion means “dislike or
### disgust”—that is, your feeling about something you can't stand to
### look at.

### revert
### (1) To go back or return (to an earlier state,
### condition, situation, etc.). (2) To be given back to (a former owner).
### • Control of the Panama Canal Zone, first acquired by the U.S. in
### 1903, reverted to the local government in 1999.
### Since the prefix re- often means “back” (see
### RE-
### ), the basic meaning
### of revert is “turn back.” Revert and reversion often show up in legal
### documents, since property is often given to another person on the
### condition that it will revert to the original owner at some future date
### or when something happens (usually the death of the second
### person). In nonlegal uses, the word tends to show up in negative
### contexts. Many reformed drinkers, for example, eventually revert to
### their old ways, and most people revert to smoking at least once or
### twice before succeeding in quitting for good.

### MORPH
### comes from the Greek word for “shape.” Morph is itself an
### English word with a brand-new meaning, which was needed when
### we began to digitally alter photographic images or shapes to make
### them move or transform themselves in often astonishing ways.

### amorphous
### Without a definite shape or form;
### shapeless.
### • Picking up an amorphous lump of clay, she molded it swiftly into a
### rough human shape.
### According to the Greek myths of the creation, the world began in an
### amorphous state; and the Bible states that, at the beginning, “the
### earth was without form, and void.” Most of us have had nightmares
### that consist mostly of just a looming amorphous but terrifying thing.
### A plan may have so little detail that critics call it amorphous. And a
### new word may appear to name a previously amorphous group of
### people, such as yuppie in 1983 and Generation X six years later.

### anthropomorphic
### (1) Having or described
### as having human form or traits. (2) Seeing human traits in
### nonhuman things.
### • The old, diseased tree had always been like a companion to her,
### though she didn't really approve of such anthropomorphic feelings.
### Anthropomorphic means a couple of different things. In its first
### sense, an anthropomorphic cup is a cup in the shape of a human,
### and anthropomorphic gods are human in appearance—like the Greek
### and Roman gods, for example, even though Socrates and others
### believed that their fellow Greeks had created the gods in their own
### image rather than the other way around. In its second sense, the
### animal characters in Aesop's fables are anthropomorphic since they
### all have human feelings and thoughts even though they don't look
### like humans. Thus, when the fox calls the grapes sour simply
### because they're out of reach, it's a very human response. Thousands
### of years after Aesop, anthropomorphism is still alive and well, in the
### animal stories of Beatrix Potter, George Orwell's Animal Farm, and
### hundreds of cartoons and comic strips.

### metamorphosis
### (1) A physical change,
### especially one supernaturally caused. (2) A developmental change in
### an animal that occurs after birth or hatching.
### • Day by day the class watched the gradual metamorphosis of the
### tadpoles into frogs.
### Many ancient myths end in a metamorphosis. As Apollo is chasing
### the nymph Daphne, she calls on her river-god father for help and he
### turns her into a laurel tree to save her. Out of anger and jealousy,
### the goddess Athena turns the marvelous weaver Arachne into a
### spider that will spin only beautiful webs. But natural substances may
### also metamorphose, or undergo metamorphosis. Heat and pressure
### over thousands of years may eventually turn tiny organisms into
### petroleum, and coal into diamonds. And the most beloved of natural
### metamorphoses (notice how this plural is formed) is probably the
### transformation of caterpillars into butterflies.

### morphology
### (1) The study of the structure and form
### of plants and animals. (2) The study of word formation.
### • The morphology of the mouthparts of the different mayfly species
### turns out to be closely related to what they feed on and their
### methods of eating.
### Within the field of biology, morphology is the study of the shapes
### and arrangement of parts of organisms, in order to determine their
### function, their development, and how they may have been shaped
### by evolution. Morphology is particularly important in classifying
### species, since it can often reveal how closely one species is related
### to another. Morphology is studied within other sciences as well,
### including astronomy and geology. And in language, morphology
### considers where words come from and why they look the way they
### do.

### FORM
### is the Latin root meaning “shape” or “form.” When you march
### in formation, you're moving in ordered patterns. And a formula is a
### standard form for expressing information, such as a rule written in
### mathematical symbols, or the “Sincerely yours” that often ends a
### letter.

### format
### (1) The shape, size, and general makeup of
### something. (2) A general plan, arrangement, or choice of material.
### • The new thesaurus would be published in three formats: as a
### hardcover book, a large paperback, and a CD-ROM.
### Format is a word that seems to gain more uses with every decade.
### Traditionally, people used the word simply to refer to the design of a
### book or newspaper page, but today that's only one of its many
### meanings. TV news shows seem to change their format, or general
### form, as often as their anchorpeople, and show types such as
### situation comedy and crime drama are often called formats. When a
### radio station gives up playing pop music to became a talk station, it's
### said to be switching formats. In the electronic age, format has also
### become widely used as a verb; thus, organizing electronic data for
### storage or other special uses is called formatting (or reformatting).

### conform
### (1) To be similar or identical; to be in
### agreement or harmony. (2) To follow ordinary standards or customs.
### • My family was too odd to really conform to the little town's ideas
### about proper behavior, but it didn't seem to bother our neighbors
### too much.
### Conform, with its prefix con-, “with” or “together,” means basically
### “to adopt the form of those around you.” Thus, employee behavior
### must usually conform with basic company policies. A certain
### philosophy may be said to conform with American values (even if we
### sometimes have a hard time agreeing on exactly what those are).
### And a Maine Coon cat or a Dandie Dinmont terrier must conform to
### its breed requirements in order to be registered for breeding
### purposes. Being a conformist is usually a safe bet; being a
### nonconformist, who ignores society's standards and the whole idea
### of conformity, can be a bit dangerous but also sometimes more fun.

### formality
### (1) An established custom or way of
### behaving that is required or standard. (2) The following of
### conventional rules.
### • The bride and groom wanted a small, intimate wedding without all
### the usual formalities.
### Formal behavior follows the proper forms or customs, and informal
### behavior feels free to ignore them. The formality of a dinner party is
### indicated by such formalities as invitations, required dress, and full
### table settings. Legal formalities, or technicalities, may turn out to be
### all-important even if they often seem minor. America requires fewer
### formalities than many other countries (in Germany, for example, you
### may know someone for years before using his or her first name), but
### even in relaxed situations Americans may be observing invisible
### formalities.

### formative
### (1) Giving or able to give form or shape;
### constructive. (2) Having to do with important growth or
### development.
### • She lived in Venezuela during her formative years and grew up
### speaking both Spanish and English.
### Whatever gives shape to something else may be called formative:
### for example, the Grand Canyon is a product of the formative power
### of water, and the automobile was a huge formative influence on the
### design of America's cities. But it usually applies to some kind of
### shaping that isn't physical. An ambitious plan, for example, goes
### through a formative stage of development. The formative years of
### the U.S. included experimentation with various forms of government.
### And the most important formative experiences in our own lives tend
### to take place in the first 20 years or so.

### Answers

### DOC/DOCT
### comes from the Latin docere, which means “to teach.”
### So, for instance, a doctor was originally a highly educated person
### capable of instructing others in a field—which usually wasn't
### medicine.

### doctrine
### (1) Something that is taught. (2) An official
### principle, opinion, or belief.
### • According to the 19th-century doctrine of “papal infallibility,” a
### pope's official statements on matters of faith and morals must be
### regarded as the absolute truth.
### The original doctrines were those of the Catholic Church, especially
### as taught by the so-called doctors (religious scholars) of the Church.
### But today a doctrine can come from many other sources. Old and
### established legal principles are called legal doctrine. Traditional
### psychiatrists still follow the doctrines of Sigmund Freud. Communist
### doctrine in the 1920s and '30s was often the teachings of Lenin,
### which were then regarded in the Soviet Union as almost sacred. U.S.
### presidents have given their names to doctrines as well: In 1823 the
### Monroe Doctrine stated that the United States would oppose
### European influence in the Americas, and in 1947 the Truman
### Doctrine held that America would support free countries against
### enemies outside and inside.

### docent
### (1) Teacher, lecturer. (2) A person who leads
### guided tours, especially through a museum.
### • Visitors to Istanbul's great Topkapi Museum often decide they need
### to hire an English-speaking docent.
### The title of docent is used in many countries for what Americans
### would call an associate professor—that is, a college or university
### teacher who has been given tenure (see
### tenure
### ) but hasn't yet
### achieved the rank of full professor. But in the U.S. a docent is a
### guide who works at a museum, a historical site, or even a zoo or a
### park. Docents are usually volunteers, and their services are often
### free of charge.

### doctrinaire
### Tending to apply principles or theories
### without regard for practical difficulties or individual circumstance.
### • She had never taken a doctrinaire approach to teaching, since
### education theories didn't always match the reality of instructing 25
### lively students.
### Someone doctrinaire sticks closely to official doctrines or principles.
### A doctrinaire judge will give identical sentences to everyone found
### guilty of a particular crime. A doctrinaire feminist may treat all men
### as if they were identical. A doctrinaire economist might call for a
### single solution for the economic problems in all countries, regardless
### of their social and cultural history. As you might guess, the word isn't
### often used in positive contexts.

### indoctrinate
### (1) To teach, especially basics or
### fundamentals. (2) To fill someone with a particular opinion or point
### of view.
### • In the Army's basic training, sergeants have 11 weeks to
### indoctrinate their new recruits with army attitudes and discipline.
### Indoctrinate simply means “brainwash” to many people today. We
### frequently hear, for example, of religious cults that indoctrinate their
### members to give up their freedom and individuality and to work hard
### only for a leader's goals. But its meaning wasn't originally negative
### at all. And the fact is that every society indoctrinates its young
### people with the values of its culture; in the U.S. we tend to be
### indoctrinated to love freedom, to be individuals, and to work hard
### for success, among many other things. But we now rarely use
### indoctrinate (or its noun, indoctrination) in a positive way; instead
### we usually stick to the simpler and safer teach or instruct.

### TUT/TUI
### comes from a Latin verb meaning “to look after,” and in
### English the root generally shows up in words that include the
### meaning “guide,” “guard,” or “teach”—such as tutor, the name for a
### private teacher who guides a student (or tutee) through a subject.

### tutorial
### (1) A class for one student or a small group of
### students. (2) An instructional program that gives information about a
### specific subject.
### • He'd been taking tutorials with the same graduate student for two
### years, and learning far more than he'd ever learned in his large
### classes.
### Tutorials with live tutors are useful for both advanced students and
### struggling ones. Many computer programs include electronic tutorials
### to help the new user get used to the program, leading him or her
### through all its functions, often by means of pictures and short
### videos. But a really difficult program may still require a real-life tutor
### to be fully understood.

### tuition
### (1) The act of teaching; instruction. (2) The
### cost of or payment for instruction.
### • As she happily flipped through her college catalogs, her parents sat
### quietly but uneasily calculating the total tuition costs.
### The sense of tuition meaning “teaching” or “instruction” is mostly
### used in Britain today. In the U.S., tuition almost always means the
### costs charged by a school, college, or university for that teaching.
### Those costs have tended to rise at an alarming rate in recent years.
### Around 2010 a student could receive a four-year college education
### (tuition, room, and board) at an inexpensive public university for less
### than $50,000, but might have to pay more than $200,000 at an
### expensive private college or university.

### intuition
### (1) The power of knowing something
### immediately without mental effort; quick insight. (2) Something
### known in this way.
### • She scoffed at the notion of “women's intuition,” special powers of
### insight and understanding in personal relations that women are
### supposed to have.
### Intuition is very close in meaning to instinct. The moment a man
### enters a room you may feel you know intuitively or instinctively
### everything about him—that is, you may intuit his basic personality.
### Highly rational people may try to ignore their intuition and insist on
### being able to explain everything they think, but artists and creative
### thinkers often tend to rely on their intuitive sense of things. Intuition
### can be closely related to their imagination, which seems to come
### from somewhere just as mysterious. Some psychologists claim that
### the left brain is mainly involved in logical thinking and the right brain
### in intuitive thinking; but the brain is terribly complex, and even if
### there's some truth to this idea, it's not terribly obvious how to make
### use of it.

### tutelage
### Instruction or guidance of an individual;
### guardianship.
### • Under the old man's expert tutelage, they had learned to carve
### and paint beautiful and realistic duck decoys.
### Tutelage usually means specialized and individual guidance.
### Alexander the Great was under the tutelage of the philosopher
### Aristotle between the ages of 13 and 16, and his tutor inspired him
### with a love of philosophy, medicine, and science. At 16 he
### commanded his first army, and by his death 16 years later he had
### founded the greatest empire ever seen. But it's not so easy to trace
### the effects of the brilliant tutelage he had received in his youth.

## Number Words
### DI/DUP
### , Greek and Latin prefixes meaning “two,” show up in both
### technical and nontechnical terms, with dup- sometimes shortened to
### du-. So a duel is a battle between two people. A duet is music for a
### duo, or pair of musicians. A duplicate is an exact copy, or twin. And
### if you have dual citizenship, you belong to two countries at once.

### dichotomy
### (1) A division into two often contradictory
### groups. (2) Something with qualities that seem to contradict each
### other.
### • Already in her first job, she noticed a dichotomy between the
### theories she'd been taught in college and the realities of professional
### life.
### In the modern world there's a dichotomy between fast and intense
### big-city life and the slower and more relaxed life in the country. But
### the dichotomy is nothing new: the Roman poet Horace was
### complaining about it in the 1st century B.C. Among other eternal
### dichotomies, there's the dichotomy between wealth and poverty,
### between the policies of the leading political parties, between a
### government's words and its actions—and between what would be
### most fun to do right this minute and what would be the mature and
### sensible alternative.

### dimorphic
### Occurring in two distinguishable forms (as
### of color or size).
### • One of a birder's challenges is identifying birds of the less colorful
### sex in dimorphic species.
### Dimorphism varies greatly in the animal kingdom. Among mammals,
### the male is generally larger than the female, but other differences in
### appearance tend to be modest. But birds are usually noticeably
### dimorphic, with the male being the more colorful sex; when we
### imagine a pheasant, a mallard, a cardinal, or a peacock, we're
### almost always picturing the male rather than the female. Among
### spiders the situation is often reversed. The golden orb-weaver
### spider, for example, is spectacularly dimorphic: the female may be
### 20 times the size of the male, and she usually ends up eating him,
### sometimes even while he's mating with her. Many sea creatures,
### including many fish, take care of gender problems by simply
### changing from one sex into the other.

### duplex
### (1) Having two principal elements; double. (2)
### Allowing electronic communication in two directions at the same
### time.
### • The upper floor of their splendid duplex apartment had a
### panoramic view of Paradise Park.
### Duplex can describe a confusing variety of things, depending on the
### technical field. Most of us use it as a noun: a duplex can be either a
### two-family house or a two-story apartment. In computer science and
### telecommunications, duplex (or full-duplex) communication can go in
### both directions at once, while half-duplex communication can go
### only one way at a time. In other areas, just translate duplex as
### “double” and see if the sentence makes sense.

### duplicity
### Deception by pretending to feel and act one
### way while acting in another.
### • By the time Jackie's duplicity in the whole matter had come to
### light, she had left town, leaving no forwarding address.
### The Greek god Zeus often resorted to duplicity to get what he
### wanted, and most of the time what he wanted was some woman.
### His duplicity usually involved a disguise: he appeared to Leda as a
### swan, and to Europa as a bull. Sometimes he had to be duplicitous
### to get around his wife, Hera. After he had had his way with Io and
### was about to get caught, he turned her into a cow to avoid Hera's
### anger.

### BI/BIN
### also means “two” or “double.” A bicycle has two wheels,
### and binoculars consist of two little telescopes. Bigamy is marriage to
### two people at once. And a road built through the middle of a
### neighborhood bisects it into two pieces.

### bipartisan
### Involving members of two political
### parties.
### • The president named a bipartisan commission of three Republicans
### and three Democrats to look into the issue.
### Partisan means basically “belonging to a party,” so something
### bipartisan combines two parties. Since the United States today
### operates with a two-party system of government (even though the
### Constitution says nothing about parties at all), legislation often must
### have some bipartisan support in order to pass into law. Bipartisan
### committees review legislation, compromising on some points and
### removing or adding others in order to make the bill more agreeable
### to both parties and make bipartisan support from the entire
### legislature or Congress more likely.

### binary
### (1) Consisting of two things or parts; double. (2)
### Involving a choice between two alternatives.
### • The Milky Way contains numerous binary stars, each consisting of
### two stars orbiting each other.
### Binary has many uses, most of them in technical terms. Almost all
### computer software, for example, is written in binary code, which
### uses only two digits, 0 and 1, 0 standing for a low-voltage impulse
### (“off”) and 1 standing for a high-voltage impulse (“on”). All
### information is kept in this form. The word “HELLO,” for example,
### looks like this: 1001000 1000101 1001100 1001100 1001111.

### biennial
### (1) Occurring every two years. (2) Continuing
### or lasting over two years.
### • The great biennial show of new art in Venice usually either puzzles
### or angers the critics.
### Biennial conventions, celebrations, competitions, and sports events
### come every two years. Biennials are plants that live two years,
### bearing flowers and fruit only in the second year. (Carrots and sugar
### beets are two examples; since we're only interested in their roots,
### we don't wait another year to see their flower and fruit.) In contrast,
### semiannual means “twice a year.” But no one can agree whether
### biweekly means “twice a week” or “every two weeks,” and whether
### bimonthly means “twice a month” or “every two months.” Maybe we
### should stop using both of them until we can decide.

### bipolar
### Having two opposed forces or views; having two
### poles or opposed points of attraction.
### • Our bipolar Earth spins on an axis that extends between the North
### and South Poles.
### Magnets are always bipolar: one pole attracts and the other repels
### or drives away. And the Cold War arms race was bipolar, since it
### mainly involved the opposing powers of the U.S. and the Soviet
### Union. But the word is encountered most often today in bipolar
### disorder, the newer name of what used to be called manic-
### depressive illness, in which the person tends to swing between the
### two extremes, or poles, of high intensity and deep depression, with
### depression being the main condition. Though an extremely serious
### illness, bipolar disorder can often be controlled by the drug lithium.
