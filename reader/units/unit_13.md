### CORD
### , from the Latin word for “heart,” turns up in several common
### English words. So does its Greek relative card-, which is familiar to
### us in words such as cardiac, “relating to the heart.”

### accord
### (1) To grant. (2) To be in harmony; agree.
### • What she told police under questioning didn't accord with the
### accounts of the other witnesses.
### A new federal law may accord with—or be in accordance with—the
### guidelines that a company has already established. The rowdy
### behavior of the hero Beowulf accords with Norse ideals of the early
### Middle Ages; but such behavior wouldn't have been in accordance
### with the ideals of a later young lord from the same general region,
### Shakespeare's Prince Hamlet. Accord is also a noun, meaning
### “agreement.” Thus, we often hear of two countries signing a peace
### accord; and we also frequently hear of two things or people being
### “in accord with” each other.

### concord
### (1) A state of agreement: harmony. (2) A
### formal agreement.
### • In 1801 Napoleon signed a concord with the pope reestablishing
### the Catholic Church in France.
### The roots of concord suggest the meaning “hearts together.” At the
### very outset of the American Revolution, the town of Concord,
### Massachusetts, was the site of a famous battle—obviously not
### exactly in keeping with its name. It shares that name with the
### capital of New Hampshire and a few other towns and cities, and
### Concordia, the original Latin word for “concord,” is the name of
### several Lutheran universities. Today concord is a rather formal term,
### probably most often used to mean a specific agreement; thus, two
### countries may sign a concord on matters that have led to trouble in
### the past.

### cordial
### Warm, friendly, gracious.
### • After the meeting, the president extended a cordial invitation to
### everyone for coffee at her own house.
### Anything that is cordial comes from the heart. Cordial greetings to
### friends on the street, or cordial relations between two countries, are
### warm without being passionate. Cordial is also a noun, which
### originally meant any stimulating medicine or drink that was thought
### to be good for the heart. Today a cordial is a liqueur, a sweetened
### alcoholic drink with interesting flavoring. Cordials such as crème de
### menthe, Drambuie, or Benedictine are alcoholic enough to warm the
### spirits and the heart.

### discordant
### Being at odds, conflicting, not in
### harmony.
### • The first discordant note at dinner was struck by my cousin, when
### he claimed the president was only interested in taking away our
### guns.
### Discord, a word more common in earlier centuries than today, means
### basically “conflict,” so discordant often means “conflicting.” The
### opinions of Supreme Court justices are frequently discordant;
### justices who disagree with the Court's decision usually write a
### dissenting opinion. Discordant is often used with a somewhat
### musical meaning, suggesting that a single wrong note or harmony
### has been heard in the middle of a performance—even though
### musical words such as chord actually come from a different Latin
### word, meaning “cord” or “string” (a reference to the strings of
### ancient instruments such as the lyre).

### CULP
### comes from the Latin word for “guilt.” Its best-known
### appearance in English is probably in culprit, meaning someone who
### is guilty of a crime.

### culpable
### Deserving to be condemned or blamed.
### • The company was found guilty of culpable negligence in allowing
### the chemical waste to leak into the groundwater.
### Culpable normally means simply “guilty.” To a lawyer, “culpable
### negligence” is carelessness so serious that it becomes a crime—for
### instance, building a swimming pool in your suburban yard with no
### fence around it, so that a neighbor's child could fall in and drown.
### But degrees of culpability are important in the law; someone who
### intended to do harm always faces a more serious challenge in court
### than someone who was merely careless.

### exculpate
### To clear from accusations of fault or guilt.
### • The girls aren't proud of what they did that night, but they've been
### exculpated by witnesses and won't be facing criminal charges.
### Exculpate gets its meaning from the prefix ex-, which here means
### “out of” or “away from.” A suspected murderer may be exculpated
### by the confession of another person. And exculpatory evidence is the
### kind that defense lawyers are always looking for.

### inculpate
### To accuse or incriminate; to show evidence
### of someone's involvement in a fault or crime.
### • It was his own father who finally inculpated him, though without
### intending to.
### Inculpate is the opposite of exculpate, just as inculpatory evidence is
### the opposite of exculpatory evidence. By inculpating someone else,
### an accused person may manage to exculpate himself. Through plea
### bargaining, the prosecution can often encourage a defendant to
### inculpate his friends in return for a lighter sentence.

### mea culpa
### An admission of personal fault or error.
### • The principal said his mea culpa at the school board meeting, but
### not all the parents were satisfied.
### Mea culpa, Latin for “through my fault,” comes from the prayer in
### the Catholic mass in which, back when Latin was still the language
### of the mass, one would confess to having sinned “mea culpa, mea
### culpa, mea maxima culpa” (“through my fault, through my fault,
### through my most grievous fault”). When we say “Mea culpa” today,
### it means “I apologize” or “It was my fault.” But mea culpa is also
### common as a noun. So, for instance, a book may be a long mea
### culpa for the author's past treatment of women, or an oil company
### may issue a mea culpa after a tanker runs aground.

### DICT
### comes from dicere, the Latin word meaning “to speak.” So a
### dictionary is a treasury of words for speaking. And a contradiction
### (with its prefix contra-, “against”) speaks against or denies
### something.

### diction
### (1) Choice of words, especially with regard to
### correctness, clearness, or effectiveness. (2) Clarity of speech.
### • Our CEO is determined to appear in some TV ads, but he first
### needs to work on his diction with a vocal coach.
### When your English teacher complains about some of the words you
### chose to use in an essay, she's talking about your diction. She may
### also use the term when commenting on the word choices made by a
### poet, and why a particular word was the best one possible in a
### particular line. (Compare
### syntax
### .) But the second meaning of diction
### is just as common, and your English teacher might use that one on
### you as well, especially when she's asked you to read something
### aloud and you mumble your way through it.

### edict
### (1) An official announcement that has the force of a
### law. (2) An order or command.
### • In 1989 an edict by the leader of Iran pronouncing a death
### sentence on a British novelist stunned the world.
### Edicts are few and far between in a democracy, since very few
### important laws can be made by a president or prime minister acting
### alone. But when a crisis arose in the Roman Republic, the senate
### would appoint a dictator, who would have the power to rule by edict.
### The idea was that the dictator could make decisions quickly, issuing
### his edicts faster than the senate could act. When the crisis was over,
### the edicts were canceled and the dictator usually retired from public
### life. Things are different today: dictators almost always install
### themselves in power, and they never give it up.

### jurisdiction
### (1) The power or right to control or
### exercise authority. (2) The territory where power may be exercised.
### • Unluckily for the defendants, the case fell within the jurisdiction of
### the federal court rather than the more tolerant state court.
### Questions of jurisdiction are generally technical legal matters. The
### most important ones include which court will hear a given case and
### which law-enforcement agency can get involved. But although they
### may seem like mere technicalities, jurisdictional matters sometimes
### turn out to be all-important in the final outcome. Jurisdiction may
### depend on where you are (for example, in which state), on who you
### are (if you're a juvenile, for example, you may only be tried in
### juvenile court), and on what the subject is (for example, cases
### involving the estate left by someone who has died are dealt with in
### probate court).

### dictum
### A formal and authoritative statement.
### • It has long been a dictum of American foreign policy that the
### government doesn't negotiate with kidnappers and terrorists.
### The word dictum is frequently used in philosophy, but also in
### economics, political science, and other fields. Almost any condensed
### piece of wisdom—”The perfect is the enemy of the good,” “Buy low,
### sell high,” “All politics is local,” etc.—can be called a dictum. In the
### law, judges may often add to a written opinion an obiter dictum, or
### “statement made in passing”—a strong statement that isn't directly
### relevant to the case being decided. If they're well thought out and
### eloquent, obiter dicta (notice the plural form) may be referred to by
### later judges and lawyers for years afterward.

### GNI/GNO
### comes from a Greek and Latin verb meaning “to know,”
### and can be found at the root of know itself. Among other words built
### from this root, you may recognize (“know again”) some and be
### ignorant of (“not know”) others. But only an ignoramus would know
### absolutely none of them.

### cognitive
### (1) Having to do with the process of
### knowing, including awareness, judgment, and understanding. (2)
### Based on factual knowledge that has been or can be gained by
### experience.
### • A child isn't a computer; a third-grader's cognitive abilities are
### highly dependent on his or her upbringing and happiness.
### Cognitive skills and knowledge involve the ability to acquire factual
### information, often the kind of knowledge that can easily be tested.
### So cognition should be distinguished from social, emotional, and
### creative development and ability. Cognitive science is a growing field
### of study that deals with human perception, thinking, and learning.

### agnostic
### A person who believes that whether God
### exists is not known and probably cannot be known.
### • Both of them were always agnostics, but after they had children
### they started attending church again.
### The words agnostic and agnosticism were coined around 1870 by
### the great English biologist T. H. Huxley, who had just spent a decade
### defending the works of Charles Darwin against the attacks of the
### church. Scientists often put a high value on evidence when arguing
### about religion, and many agnostic thinkers believe that human
### minds simply aren't equipped to grasp the nature of God. But
### agnostics differ from atheists, who actually claim that no God exists
### and may even think they can prove it. You may have seen the similar
### word gnostic, the name for followers of certain religious sects from
### around the time of Christ that sought spiritual knowledge and
### rejected the material world. An increasing interest in gnosticism
### today can be seen in the popular novels of Philip Pullman, Dan
### Brown, and Neil Gaiman.

### incognito
### In disguise, or with one's identity
### concealed.
### • Years after her reign as a top Hollywood star, she was discovered
### working incognito as a bartender in Manhattan while living in cheap
### hotels.
### In a famous myth, Zeus and Hermes visit a village incognito to test
### the villagers. The seemingly poor travelers are turned away from
### every household except that of Baucis and Philemon. This elderly
### couple, though very poor themselves, provide the disguised gods
### with a feast. When the gods finally reveal themselves, they reward
### the couple generously for their hospitality, but destroy the rest of the
### village.

### prognosis
### (1) The chance of recovery from a given
### disease or condition. (2) A forecast or prophecy.
### • The prognosis for a patient with chicken pox is usually excellent;
### the prognosis for someone with liver cancer is terrible.
### With its prefix pro-, meaning “before,” prognosis means basically
### “knowledge beforehand” of how a situation is likely to turn out.
### Prognosis was originally a strictly medical term, but it soon
### broadened to include predictions made by experts of all kinds. Thus,
### for example, economists are constantly offering prognoses (notice
### the irregular plural form) about where the economy is going, and
### climate scientists regularly prognosticate about how quickly the
### earth's atmosphere is warming.

### GRAPH
### comes from the Greek verb graphein, “to write.” Thus, a
### biography is a written account of someone's life (see
### BIO
### ), a
### discography is a written list of recordings on disc (records or CDs),
### and a filmography is a list of motion pictures. But lots of uses of -
### graph and -graphy don't mean literally “writing” (as in autograph or
### paragraph), but instead something more like “recording,” as in
### photography, seismograph, or graph itself.

### calligraphy
### The
### art
### of
### producing
### beautiful
### handwriting.
### • Calligraphy can be seen today in event invitations, logo designs,
### and stone inscriptions.
### Kalli- is a Greek root meaning “beautiful,” and “beautiful” in the case
### of calligraphy means artistic, stylized, and elegant. Calligraphy has
### existed in many cultures, including Indian, Persian, and Islamic
### cultures; Arabic puts a particularly high value on beautiful script, and
### in East Asia calligraphy has long been considered a major art.
### Calligraphers in the West use pens with wide nibs, with which they
### produce strokes of widely differing width within a single letter.

### hagiography
### (1) Biography of saints. (2)
### Biography that idealizes or idolizes.
### • According to the new biography, which should really be called a
### hagiography, the former prime minister doesn't seem to have done
### anything small-minded or improper in his entire life.
### For those able to read, reading stories of the lives of the saints was
### a popular pastime for centuries, and books collecting short saints'
### biographies were best sellers. These often included terrifically
### colorful stories (about slaying dragons, magically traveling through
### space, etc.) that were perhaps a bit too good to be strictly true, and
### after finding God not one of them ever did a single thing that wasn't
### saintly—and some of them may not have actually existed. Still today,
### hagiographic accounts of the lives of politicians and pop-culture stars
### are being written, though there now seems to be a bigger audience
### for biographies that seek out the not-so-wholesome secrets of the
### person's life, sometimes even making up a few of them.

### choreography
### (1) The art of composing and
### arranging dances and of representing them in symbolic notation. (2)
### The movements by dancers in a performance.
### • The reviews praised the show for its eye-catching choreography,
### calling it the best element of the whole musical.
### In ancient Greece, a choreia was a circular dance accompanied by a
### singing chorus. But the actual notating of dances by means of
### symbols didn't begin until the 17th or 18th century, when ballet
### developed into a complex art form in France. The choreographer of a
### major ballet, which might run to an hour or more, will always record
### his or her work in notation, though choreographing a five-minute
### segment for a TV talent show usually doesn't require any record at
### all.

### lithograph
### A picture made by printing from a flat
### surface (such as a smooth stone) prepared so that the ink will only
### stick to the design that will be printed.
### • To make a lithograph, the artist first draws an image, in reverse,
### on a fine-grained limestone or aluminum plate.
### Lithos is Greek for “stone,” and a stone surface has traditionally been
### involved in lithography, though a metal plate may take its place
### today. The lithographic process was invented around 1796 and soon
### became the main method of printing books and newspapers. Artists
### use lithography to produce prints (works intended to be sold in many
### copies), and art lithographs sometimes resemble older types of
### prints, including etchings, engravings, and woodcuts. Pablo Picasso,
### Marc Chagall, Joan Miró, and M. C. Escher are among the many
### artists who have used lithography to produce important original
### works. Today lithographic printing accounts for over 40% of all
### printing, packaging, and publishing.

### ART
### comes from the Latin word for “skill.” This reminds us that,
### until a few centuries ago, almost no one made a strong distinction
### between skilled craftsmanship and what we would now call “art.”
### And the word art itself could also mean simply “cleverness.” The
### result is that this root appears in some words where we might not
### expect it.

### artful
### (1) Skillful. (2) Wily, crafty, sly.
### • It was an artful solution: each side was pleased with the
### agreement, but it was the lawyer himself who stood to make the
### most money off of it.
### A writer may produce an artful piece of prose, one that's clearly and
### elegantly written. The same writer might also make an artful
### argument, one that cleverly leaves out certain details and plays up
### others so as to make a stronger case. In the first instance, the prose
### is well crafted; in the second, the argument might instead be called
### crafty. But even though both uses are correct, most of us still use
### artful somewhat differently from artistic.

### artifact
### A usually simple object made by human
### workmanship, such as a tool or ornament, that represents a culture
### or a stage in a culture's development.
### • Through the artifacts found by archaeologists, we now know a
### considerable amount about how the early Anasazi people of the
### Southwest lived.
### One of the things that make humans unique is their ability to make
### and use tools, and ever since the first rough stone axes began to
### appear about 700,000 years ago, human cultures have left behind
### artifacts from which we've tried to draw a picture of their everyday
### life. The roots of artifact mean basically “something made with skill”;
### thus, a mere stone that was used for pounding isn't an artifact, since
### it wasn't shaped by humans for its purpose—unlike a ram's horn that
### was polished and given a brass mouthpiece and was blown as part
### of a religious ritual.

### artifice
### (1) Clever skill. (2) A clever trick.
### • By his cunning and artifice, Iago convinces Othello that
### Desdemona has been unfaithful.
### Artifice can be a tricky word to use. It combines the same roots as
### artifact, so it's sometimes seen in descriptions of craftsmanship
### (“The artifice that went into this jewelry can still astound us,” “The
### chef had used all his artifice to disguise the nature of the meat”).
### But it can also be used for many situations that don't involve
### physical materials (“They had gotten around the rules by a clever
### artifice,” “The artifice of the plot is ingenious”). Like its adjective,
### artificial, artifice isn't necessarily either positive nor negative. But
### both words can make us slightly uncomfortable if we like to think of
### simplicity and naturalness as important values.

### artisan
### A skilled worker or craftsperson.
### • At the fair, they saw examples of the best carving, pottery, and
### jewelry by local artisans.
### Artisans aren't the same as artists, but it can sometimes be hard to
### tell the difference. In the Middle Ages, artisans organized themselves
### into guilds. In every city each group of artisans—weavers,
### carpenters, shoemakers, and so on—had its own guild, which set
### wages and prices, kept standards high, and protected its members
### from outside competitors. In America, however, most artisans have
### always been fiercely independent. Today, when factories produce
### almost all of our goods, artisans usually make only fine objects for
### those who can afford them. And we now even include food among
### the artisan's crafts, so you can buy artisanal cheeses, breads, and
### chocolates—but probably not if you're watching your budget.

### FORT
### comes from fortis, Latin for “strong.” The familiar noun fort,
### meaning a building strengthened against possible attacks, comes
### directly from it. And our verb comfort actually means “to give
### strength and hope to.”

### fortify
### To strengthen.
### • Fortified by a good night's sleep and a big breakfast, they set off
### for the final 20 miles of their journey.
### Medieval cities were fortified against attack by high walls, and
### volunteers may fortify a levee against an overflowing river by means
### of sandbags. Foods can be fortified by adding vitamins, but “fortified
### wines,” such as sherry and port, have brandy (a “stronger” drink)
### rather than vitamins added to them. By adopting good exercise
### habits, you can fortify your body against illness. And fortifying
### needn't always be physical. An author's reputation may be fortified
### by the success of his new book, or a prosecutor can fortify a case
### against a suspect by finding more evidence.

### fortification
### (1) The building of military
### defenses to protect a place against attack. (2) A structure built to
### protect a place.
### • The city's fortifications had withstood powerful assaults by
### catapults, battering rams, and tall siege towers that rolled up to
### release soldiers onto the top of the walls.
### In the Middle Ages, many European cities were entirely enclosed by
### sturdy walls, with walkways along the top and towers at intervals,
### designed to make an invasion impossible. A water-filled ditch, or
### moat, might run alongside the wall for added defense. Such
### defenses turned the entire city into a fort, or fortress. Over the
### centuries, fortifications changed steadily with the development of
### new weaponry. In World War II, the German fortification of the
### French coast included antitank barriers, bunkers, minefields, and
### underwater obstacles, but it wasn't enough to turn back the
### immense force of the Allied invasion on D-day.

### forte
### Something that a person does
### particularly well; one's strong point.
### • Her forte was statistics, and she was always at a disadvantage
### when the discussion turned to public policy.
### In the Middle Ages, swords were often known to break in battle, so
### the strongest part of a sword's blade—the part between the handle
### (or hilt) and the middle of the blade—was given a name, the forte.
### Today a forte is usually a special strength. But no one can agree on
### how to pronounce it: all three pronunciations shown above are
### heard frequently. Part of the problem is confusion with the Italian
### musical term forte (always pronounced /
### f
### r-
### t
### /), meaning “loud.”

### fortitude
### Mental strength that allows one to face
### danger, pain, or hardship with courage.
### • He's just too nice, and we worry that he won't have the fortitude
### to deal with the monsters in that office.
### How many people know that the famous marble lions that guard the
### steps of the New York Public Library in Manhattan are named
### Patience and Fortitude? In Latin, the quality of fortitudo combines
### physical strength, vigor, courage, and boldness, but the English
### fortitude usually means simply firmness and steadiness of will, or
### “backbone.” The philosopher Plato long ago listed four essential
### human virtues—prudence (i.e., good judgment), justice (i.e., ability
### to be fair in balancing between one's own interests and others'),
### temperance (i.e., moderation or restraint), and fortitude, and in
### Christian tradition these became known as the four “cardinal
### virtues.”

### CIS
### comes from the Latin verb meaning “to cut, cut down, or slay.”
### An incisor is one of the big front biting teeth; beavers and
### woodchucks have especially large ones. A decision “cuts off”
### previous discussion and uncertainty.

### concise
### Brief and condensed, especially in expression or
### statement.
### • Professor Childs's exam asked for a concise, one-page summary of
### the causes of the American Revolution.
### Many students think that adding unnecessary sentences with long
### words will make their writing more impressive. But in fact almost
### every reader values concision, since concise writing is usually easier
### to read, better thought out, and better organized—that is, simply
### better writing. Words such as short don't have the full meaning of
### concise, which usually means not just “brief” but “packed with
### information.”

### excise
### To cut out, especially surgically.
### • The ancient Minoans from the island of Crete apparently excised
### the hearts of their human sacrifices.
### Excise takes part of its meaning from the prefix ex-, “out.” A writer
### may excise long passages of a novel to reduce it to a reasonable
### length, or a film director may excise a scene that might give offense.
### A surgeon may excise a large cancerous tumor, or make a tiny
### excision to examine an organ's tissue. Excise is also a noun,
### meaning a tax paid on something manufactured and sold in the U.S.
### Much of what consumers pay for tobacco or alcohol products go to
### cover the excise taxes that the state and federal government charge
### the manufacturers. But it's only accidental that this noun is spelled
### like the verb, since it comes from a completely different source.

### incisive
### Impressively direct and decisive.
### • A few incisive questions were all that was needed to expose the
### weakness in the prosecutor's case.
### From its roots, incise means basically “to cut into.” So just as a
### doctor uses a scalpel to make an incision in the skin, an incisive
### remark cuts into the matter at hand. A good analyst makes incisive
### comments about a news story, cutting through the unimportant
### details, and a good critic incisively identifies a book's strengths and
### weaknesses.

### precision
### Exactness and accuracy.
### • By junior year she was speaking with greater precision, searching
### for exact words in place of the crude, awkward language of her
### friends.
### Many of us often use precision and accuracy as synonyms, but not
### scientists and engineers. For them, accuracy describes a particular
### measurement—that is, how close it is to the truth. But precision
### describes a measurement system—that is, how good it is at giving
### the same result every time it measures the same thing. This may be
### why even nonscientists now often speak of “precision instruments”
### for measuring, “precision landings” made by airplanes, “precision
### drilling” for natural gas, and so on.

## Animal Words
### apiary
### A place where bees are kept for their honey.
### • Apple orchards are excellent sites for apiaries, since the bees keep
### the apple trees productive by pollinating them.
### Beekeeping, or apiculture, is the care of honeybees that ensures that
### they produce more honey than they can use. An apiary usually
### consists of many separate beehives. The social life of a hive is
### strange and marvelous. The queen bee, who will become the mother
### of an entire colony, is actually created by being fed “royal jelly” while
### she is still only a larva. The tens of thousands of worker bees are
### underdeveloped females; only a handful of the bees are male, and
### they do no work at all. The workers defend the hive by kamikaze
### means, stinging any intruder and dying as they do so. There's more
### drama in a quiet-looking apiary than the casual observer might
### notice.

### caper
### (1) A playful leap. (2) A prank or mischievous
### adventure.
### • For their caper in the girls' bathroom, all three seniors were
### suspended for a week.
### Caper in Latin means “a male goat.” Anyone who has watched a
### young goat frolic in a field or clamber onto the roof of a car knows
### the kind of crazy fun the English word caper —which is also a verb—
### is referring to. A capriole is a backward kick done in midair by a
### trained horse. Capricorn, meaning “horned goat,” is a constellation
### and one of the signs of the zodiac. And a capricious act is one that's
### done with as little thought as a frisky goat might give it.

### equestrian
### Of or relating to horseback riding.
### • The circus's equestrian acts, in which bareback riders performed
### daring acrobatic feats atop prancing horses, were her favorites.
### Equestrian comes from equus, Latin for “horse.” Old statues of
### military heroes, like the famous one of General Sherman on New
### York's Fifth Avenue, are frequently equestrian. In these sculptures
### the man always sits nobly upright on a horse, but the horse's stance
### varies; depending on whether the rider was killed in battle or
### survived, was victorious or defeated, the horse traditionally stands
### with four, three, or two hooves on the ground. Equestrian statues
### have been popular through the centuries, because until the 20th
### century almost every officer in Europe and America was trained in
### equestrian skills and combat.

### lupine
### Like a wolf; wolfish.
### • Doctors reported that the boy showed lupine behavior such as
### snarling and biting, and walked with his knees bent in a kind of
### crouch.
### Lupine comes from lupus, Latin for “wolf,” and its related adjective
### lupinus, “wolfish.” Lupine groups have a highly organized social
### structure, with leaders and followers clearly distinguished; dogs,
### since they're descended from wolves, often show these lupine
### patterns when living in groups. Stories of children raised by wolves
### (the most famous being Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome)
### have generally been hard to prove, partly because “wild” children
### lack human language abilities and can't describe their experiences.
### Lupine is also a noun, the name of a well-known garden flower,
### which was once thought to drain, or “wolf,” the soil of its nutrients.

### ovine
### Of, relating to, or resembling sheep.
### • In her veterinary practice she specialized in ovine medicine, but
### often treated cows and pigs as well.
### Sheep belong to the same family of mammals as goats, antelope,
### bison, buffalo, and cows. The genus Ovis includes at least five
### species, including the domestic sheep. Some 12,000 years ago, in
### the area now known as Iraq, sheep became one of the first animals
### to be domesticated; only the dog is known to have been tamed
### earlier. At first, they were valued for their milk, skin, and meat
### (mutton and lamb); not until about 1500 B.C. did the weaving of
### wool begin. Today a billion sheep are being farmed worldwide. The
### term ovine (which is a noun as well as an adjective) is mostly used
### in scientific and medical writing—which means you could impress
### your friends by dropping it into a casual conversation.

### ornithologist
### A person who studies birds.
### • John James Audubon, the great painter of the birds of early
### America, was also a writing ornithologist of great importance.
### The Greek root ornith- means “bird,” so ornithology is the study of
### birds. Amateur ornithology, usually called birding or birdwatching, is
### an extraordinarily popular pastime in America, where over 40 million
### people pursue it. Roger Tory Peterson's many field guides have long
### been some of the amateur ornithologist's most useful tools.
### Amateurs often make essential contributions to serious ornithology,
### as in the annual Christmas Bird Count, when tens of thousands of
### birders fan out across North and South America to produce a kind of
### census of all the species in the New World.

### serpentine
### Like a snake or serpent in shape or
### movement; winding.
### • The Great Wall of China, the greatest construction of all time,
### wends its serpentine way for some 4,000 miles across the Chinese
### landscape.
### A snake moves by curving and winding along the ground. Roads
### through the Pyrenees, the mountains that separate Spain from
### France, tend to be serpentine, curving back and forth on themselves
### up and down the steep slopes. Serpentine has other meanings as
### well. As a noun, it's the name for a soft green mineral, and also for
### the party streamers you might throw at midnight on New Year's Eve.
### The serpentine belt under the hood in your car is the long, looping
### belt that most of the car's accessories—the AC, the power steering,
### the alternator, and so on—depend on to get their power.

### simian
### Having to do with monkeys or apes; monkeylike.
### • Every afternoon the pale youth could be found watching the simian
### antics in the Monkey House with strange intensity.
### The Latin word for “ape” is simia, which itself comes from simus,
### “snub-nosed.” Simian is usually a scientific word; thus, for instance,
### biologists study simian viruses in the search for cures to AIDS and
### other diseases. But simian can be used by the rest of us to describe
### human behavior. Human babies often cling to their mothers in a
### simian way, and kids playing on a jungle gym may look like simians.
### But if you notice that a friend has a simian style of walking or eating
### bananas, it might be best not to tell him.
