### AMBI
### means “on both sides” or “around”; ambi- comes from Latin.
### Most of us are either right-handed or left-handed, but ambidextrous
### people can use their right and left hand equally well.

### ambiguous
### (1) Doubtful or uncertain especially
### from being obscure or indistinct. (2) Unclear in meaning because of
### being understandable in more than one way.
### • Successful politicians are good at giving ambiguous answers to
### questions on difficult issues.
### Ambiguous comes from the Latin verb ambigere, “to be undecided.”
### When we say someone's eyes are an ambiguous color, we mean we
### cannot decide which color they are—blue or green? The ambiguity of
### the Mona Lisa's smile makes us wonder what she's thinking about.
### An ambiguous order is one that can be taken in at least two ways;
### on the other hand, the order “Shut up!” may be rude but at least it's
### unambiguous.

### ambient
### Existing or present on all sides.
### • The ambient lighting in the restaurant was low, and there was a
### bright candle at each table.
### Ambient light is the light that fills an area or surrounds something
### that's being viewed, like a television screen or a painting. Scientists
### sometimes refer to the ambient temperature, the temperature of the
### surrounding air. “Ambient music” is the term used today for
### “atmospheric” background music usually intended for relaxation or
### meditation. The candlelit restaurant in the example sentence is
### probably trying for a romantic ambience, or “atmosphere.”

### ambivalent
### (1) Holding opposite feelings and
### attitudes at the same time toward someone or something. (2)
### Continually wavering between opposites or alternative courses of
### action.
### • He was ambivalent about the trip: he badly wanted to travel but
### hated to miss the summer activities at home.
### Ambivalent is a fairly new word, less than a hundred years old, and,
### not surprisingly, it was first used by psychologists. Since being
### ambivalent means simply having mixed feelings about some question
### or issue, some of us spend most of our lives in a state of
### ambivalence. We might feel ambivalence about accepting a high-
### paying job that requires us to work long hours, about lending money
### to someone we like but don't know well—or about ordering a Tutti-
### Frutti Chocolate Banana Sundae El Supremo after we've been
### starving on a strict diet for weeks.

### ambit
### The range or limit covered by something (such as a
### law).
### • The treatment of farm animals generally falls outside the ambit of
### animal-cruelty laws in the U.S.
### Ambit is a rather formal term, often used by lawyers, as in, “With
### this new legislation, tobacco now falls within the ambit of FDA
### regulation.” It almost always refers to something abstract rather than
### an actual physical range. So, for example, an immigrant might live
### completely within the ambit of her immigrant community until she
### started college, where she might find herself in a much broader
### social ambit. Most of the Latin American colonies were established
### by Spain, but in the 19th century, as the U.S. became stronger and
### Spain became weaker, they began to enter the ambit of U.S. power.

### EPI
### is a Greek prefix that may mean various things, but usually “on,
### over” or “attached to.” So an earthquake's epicenter is the ground
### right over the center of the quake. And your epidermis is the outer
### layer of your skin, on top of the inner dermis.

### epilogue
### The final section after the main part of a book
### or play.
### • Her editor told her the book really needed an epilogue, to tell
### where each member of the family is today.
### From its Greek roots, epilogue means basically “words attached (at
### the end).” An epilogue often somehow wraps up a story's action, as
### in the one for a famous Shakespeare play that ends, “For never was
### a story of more woe / Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.” In
### nonfiction books, we now often use the term afterword instead of
### epilogue, just as we now generally use foreword instead of prologue
### (see
### LOG
### ). Movies also often have a kind of epilogue—maybe a
### scene after the exciting climax when the surviving lovers meet in a
### café to talk about their future. The epilogue of a musical
### composition, after all the drama is over, is called the coda (Italian for
### “tail”).

### epiphyte
### A plant that obtains its nutrients from the air
### and the rain and usually grows on another plant for support.
### • The strangler fig begins life as an epiphyte on a tree branch, drops
### its tendrils to take root in the ground around the trunk, and slowly
### covers and strangles the tree to death.
### Epiphytic plants are sometimes known as “air plants” because they
### seemingly survive on thin air. They rely on their host plants merely
### for physical support, not nourishment. Tropical epiphytes include
### orchids, ferns, and members of the pineapple family. To a newcomer
### in the tropical rain forest, the first sight of a great tree with large
### epiphytes hanging from every level can be eerie and astonishing.
### Familiar epiphytes of the temperate zone include lichens, mosses,
### and algae, which may grow on rocks or water without touching the
### soil.

### epitaph
### An inscription on a grave or tomb in memory of
### the one buried there.
### • The great architect Christopher Wren designed London's majestic
### St. Paul's Cathedral, the site of his tomb and epitaph: “Si
### monumentum requiris, circumspice” (“If you seek my monument,
### look around you”).
### Epitaph includes the root from the Greek word taphos, “tomb” or
### “funeral.” Traditionally, epitaph refers to a tombstone inscription, but
### it can also refer to brief memorial statements that resemble such
### inscriptions. One of the most famous is Henry Lee's epitaph for
### George Washington: “First in war, first in peace, and first in the
### hearts of his countrymen.”

### epithet
### (1) A descriptive word or phrase occurring with
### or in place of the name of a person or thing. (2) An insulting or
### demeaning word or phrase.
### • King Richard I of England earned the epithet “Lionhearted,” while
### his brother, King John, was given the epithet “Lackland.”
### From its Greek roots, epithet would mean something “put on,” or
### added. Sometimes the added name follows a given name, as in Erik
### the Red or Billy the Kid. In other cases, the epithet precedes the
### personal name, as in Mahatma (“Great-souled”) Gandhi. In still
### others, it's used in place of the actual name, as in El Greco (“The
### Greek”) or El Cid (“The Lord”). In its other common meaning, an
### epithet is a mocking or insulting name (like “Lackland” in the
### example sentence). When enemies are said to be “hurling epithets”
### at each other, it means they're exchanging angry insults.

### HYP/HYPO
### is a Greek prefix meaning “below, under.” Many hypo-
### words are medical. A hypodermic needle injects medication under
### the skin. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, can be just as
### unhealthy as the better-known hypertension, or high blood pressure.

### hypochondriac
### A person overly concerned
### with his or her own health who often suffers from delusions of
### physical disease.
### • Hercule Poirot, the detective hero of the Agatha Christie mysteries,
### is a notorious hypochondriac, always trying to protect himself from
### drafts.
### One disease
### a
### hypochondriac really does
### suffer
### from is
### hypochondria, the anxiety and depression that come from worrying
### too much about one's own health. Even though it's easy to joke
### about hypochondriacs, hypochondria is no joking matter for the
### sufferer. Somewhat surprisingly, the second part of hypochondria
### derives from chondros, the Greek word for “cartilage.” The cartilage
### in question is that of the sternum, or breastbone. From ancient
### times, doctors believed that certain internal organs or regions were
### the seat of various diseases, both physical and mental, and the area
### under the breastbone was thought to be the source of hypochondria.

### hypoglycemia
### Abnormal decrease of sugar in
### the blood.
### • She had been controlling her hypoglycemia through diet and
### vitamins, but she now realized she needed to add daily exercise as
### well.
### The root glyk- means “sweet” in Greek, so glyc shows up in the
### names of various terms referring to a sugar as a chemical ingredient,
### such as glycerine and monoglyceride. People with diabetes have
### difficulty controlling the sugar in their blood. Too little can be
### dangerous; its early symptoms may be as minor as nervousness,
### shaking, and sweating, but it can lead to seizures and
### unconsciousness. Luckily, it can be taken care of easily by eating or
### drinking
### something
### high
### in
### carbohydrates.
### Its
### opposite,
### hyperglycemia (see
### HYPER
### ), is the main symptom of diabetes, and
### usually requires an injection of insulin, which the sufferer usually
### gives himself. Today many people—though not doctors—use
### hypoglycemia to mean a completely different condition, with some of
### the same milder symptoms, that doesn't involve low blood sugar.

### hypothermia
### Subnormal temperature of the
### body.
### • By the time rescuers were able to pull the boy from the pond's icy
### waters, hypothermia had reached a life-threatening stage.
### Hypothermia, which usually results from submersion in icy water or
### prolonged exposure to cold, may constitute a grave medical
### emergency. It begins to be a concern when body temperature dips
### below 95°F, and the pulse, breathing, and blood pressure start to
### decline. Below 90°, the point at which the normal reaction of
### shivering ceases, emergency treatment is called for.

### hypothetical
### (1) Involving an assumption made
### for the sake of argument or for further study or investigation. (2)
### Imagined for purposes of example.
### • The candidate refused to say what she would do if faced with a
### hypothetical military crisis.
### The noun hypothesis comes straight from the Greek word meaning
### “foundation” or “base”—that is something “put under” something
### else. So a hypothesis is something you assume to be true in order
### that you can use it as the base or basis for a line of reasoning—and
### any such assumption can be called hypothetical. So, for example,
### the theory that the dinosaurs became extinct because of a giant
### meteor that struck the earth near the Yucatán Peninsula involves the
### hypothesis that such a collision would have had such terrible effects
### on the earth's climate that the great reptiles would have been
### doomed. Once a hypothesis has been thoroughly studied and
### researched without being proved wrong, it generally comes to be
### called a theory instead.

### THERM/THERMO
### comes from the Greek word meaning “warm.” A
### thermometer measures the amount of warmth in a body, the air, or
### an oven. A thermostat makes sure the temperature stays at the
### same level. And it's easy to see why the German manufacturers of a
### vacuum-insulated bottle back in 1904 gave it the name Thermos.

### thermal
### (1) Of, relating to, or caused by heat. (2)
### Designed to insulate in order to retain body heat.
### • A special weave called thermal weave traps insulating air in little
### pockets to increase the warmth of long underwear and blankets.
### In days gone by, much of the male population of the northern states
### in the cold months would wear a garment of thermal underwear
### covering the entire body, called a union suit. Union suits kept
### sodbusters, cowboys, and townsfolk alike not only warm but also
### itchy and a little on the smelly side (back when bathing once a week
### was considered the height of cleanliness). Thermal imaging is
### photography that captures “heat pictures”—rather than ordinary light
### pictures—of objects. And thermal pollution occurs when industrial
### water use ends up warming a river in a damaging way. Small-plane
### pilots use thermal as a noun for a warm updraft, often over a
### plowed field or desert, that lifts their wings, just as it enables hawks
### to soar upward without moving their wings.

### thermodynamics
### Physics that deals with
### the mechanical actions or relations of heat.
### • With his college major in electrical engineering, he assumed it
### would be an easy step to a graduate-school concentration in
### thermodynamics.
### Thermodynamics (see
### DYNAM
### ) is based on the fact that all forms of
### energy, including heat and mechanical energy, are basically the
### same. Thus, it deals with the ways in which one form of energy is
### converted into another, when one of the forms is heat. The study of
### thermodynamics dates from before the invention of the first practical
### steam engine—an engine that uses steam to produce physical power
### —in the 18th century. Today most of the world's electrical power is
### actually produced by steam engines, and the principal use of
### thermodynamics is in power production.

### thermonuclear
### Of or relating to the changes
### in the nucleus of atoms with low atomic weight, such as hydrogen,
### that require a very high temperature to begin.
### • In the 1950s and '60s, anxious American families built thousands
### of underground “fallout shelters” to protect themselves from the
### radiation of a thermonuclear blast.
### Nuclear is the adjective for nucleus, the main central part of an
### atom. The original nuclear explosives, detonated in 1945, were so-
### called fission bombs, since they relied on the fission, or splitting, of
### the nuclei of uranium atoms. But an even greater source of
### destructive power lay in nuclear fusion, the forcing together of
### atomic nuclei. The light and heat given off by stars such as the sun
### come from a sustained fusion—or thermonuclear—reaction deep
### within it. On earth, such thermonuclear reactions were used to
### develop the hydrogen bomb, a bomb based on a fusion reaction that
### merged
### hydrogen
### atoms
### to
### become
### helium
### atoms.
### The
### thermonuclear era, which began in 1952, produced bombs hundreds
### of times more powerful than those exploded at the end of World War
### II. Why the thermo- in thermonuclear? Because great heat is
### required to trigger the fusion process, and the trigger used is
### actually a fission bomb.

### British thermal unit
### The quantity of heat required to raise the
### temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit at a
### specified temperature.
### • Wood-stove manufacturers compete with each other in their claims
### of how many British thermal units of heat output their stoves can
### produce.
### Despite its name, the British thermal unit, or BTU, may be more
### widely used in North America than in Britain. Air conditioners,
### furnaces, and stoves are generally rated by BTUs. (Though “BTUs” is
### often short for “BTUs per hour”; in air-conditioner ratings, for
### instance, “BTUs” really means “BTUs of cooling capacity per hour.”)
### Fuels such as natural gas and propane are also compared using
### BTUs. The BTU first appeared in 1876 and isn't part of the metric
### system—the metric unit of energy is the much smaller joule—so it
### isn't much used by scientists, but its practicality keeps it popular for
### consumer goods and fuels. A better-known heat unit is the calorie; a
### BTU is equal to about 252 calories. (Since the familiar food calorie is
### actually a kilocalorie, a BTU equals only about a quarter of a food
### calorie.)

### POLY
### comes from polys, the Greek word for “many.” A polytechnic
### institute offers instruction in many technical fields. Polygamy is
### marriage in which one has many spouses, or at least more than the
### legal limit of one. And polysyllabic words are words of many syllables
### —of which there are quite a few in this book.

### polyp
### (1) A sea invertebrate that has a mouth opening at
### one end surrounded by stinging tentacles. (2) A growth projecting
### from a mucous membrane, as on the colon or vocal cords.
### • She had had a polyp removed from her throat, and for two weeks
### afterward she could only whisper.
### This term comes from polypous, a Greek word for “octopus,” which
### meant literally “many-footed.” To the untrained eye, the invertebrate
### known as the polyp may likewise appear to be many-footed, though
### it never walks anywhere since its “feet” are tentacles, used for
### stinging tiny organisms which the polyp then devours. The types of
### tumor known as polyps got their name because some seem to be
### attached to the surface by branching “foot”-like roots, even though
### most do not. Polyps of the nose or vocal cords are usually only
### inconvenient, causing breathing difficulty or hoarseness, and can be
### removed easily; however, polyps in the intestines can sometimes
### turn cancerous.

### polyglot
### (1) One who can speak or write several
### languages. (2) Having or using several languages.
### • As trade between countries increases, there is more need for
### polyglots who can act as negotiators.
### Polyglot contains the root glot, meaning “language.” It is used both
### as a noun and as an adjective. Thus, we could say that an
### international airport is bound to be polyglot, with people from all
### over the world speaking their native languages. One of history's
### more interesting polyglots was the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V,
### who claimed that he addressed his horse only in German, conversed
### with women in Italian and with men in French, but reserved Spanish
### (his original language) for his talks with God.

### polymer
### A chemical compound formed by a reaction in
### which two or more molecules combine to form larger molecules with
### repeating structural units.
### • Nylon, a polymer commercially introduced in 1938, can be spun
### and woven into fabrics or cast as tough, elastic blocks.
### There are many natural polymers, including shellac, cellulose, and
### rubber. But synthetic polymers only came into being around 1870
### with Celluloid, known especially for its use in photographic film. After
### many decades of development, the polymeric compounds now
### include polypropylene, used in milk crates, luggage, and hinges;
### polyurethane, used in paints, adhesives, molded items, rubbers, and
### foams; and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), used to make pipes that won't
### rust. And let's not forget polyester, which gave us a lot of uncool
### clothing in the 1970s but whose strength and resistance to corrosion
### have ensured that it remains an extremely useful material for all
### kinds of goods.

### polygraph
### An instrument for recording changes in
### several bodily functions (such as blood pressure and rate of
### breathing) at the same time; lie detector.
### • My brother-in-law is completely law-abiding, but he's such a
### nervous type that he's failed two polygraph tests at job interviews.
### With its graph- root (see
### GRAPH
### ), polygraph indicates that it writes
### out several different results. A polygraph's output consists of a set of
### squiggly lines on a computer screen, each indicating one function
### being tested. The functions most commonly measured are blood
### pressure, breathing rate, pulse, and perspiration, all of which tend to
### increase when you lie. Polygraphs have been in use since 1924, and
### have gotten more sensitive over the years, though many experts still
### believe that they're unreliable and that a prepared liar can fool the
### machine. They're used not only for law enforcement but perhaps
### more often by employers—often the police department itself!—who
### don't want to hire someone who has broken the law in the past but
### won't admit to it.

### PRIM
### comes from primus, the Latin word for “first.” Something
### primary is first in time, rank, or importance. Something primitive is in
### its first stage of development. And something primeval had its origin
### in the first period of world or human history.

### primal
### Basic or primitive.
### • There was always a primal pleasure in listening to the rain beat on
### the roof at night and dropping off to sleep in front of the fire.
### Primal
### generally
### describes
### something
### powerful
### and
### almost
### instinctual. So when we speak of the primal innocence of youth or
### the primal intensity of someone's devotion, we're suggesting that
### the emotions or conditions being described are basic to our animal
### nature. Sitting around a campfire may feel like a primal experience,
### in which we share the emotions of our cave-dwelling ancestors.
### Intense fear of snakes or spiders may have primal roots, owing to
### the poison that some species carry. In “primal scream” therapy,
### popular in the 1970s, patients relive painful childhood experiences
### and express their frustration and anger through uncontrolled
### screaming and even violence.

### primer
### (1) A small book for teaching children to read. (2)
### A small introductory book on a subject.
### • She announced that she'd be passing out a primer on mutual funds
### at the end of the talk.
### Primers were once a standard part of every child's education. The
### first primer printed in North America, The New England Primer (ca.
### 1690), was typical; it contained many quotations from the Bible and
### many moral lessons, and the text was accompanied by numerous
### woodcut illustrations. We no longer use the word in early education,
### but it's widely used in everyday speech. Notice how primer is
### pronounced; don't mix it up with the kind of paint that's pronounced
### with a long i sound.

### primate
### Any member of the group of animals that
### includes human beings, apes, and monkeys.
### • Dr. Leakey sent three young women to work with individual
### primates: Jane Goodall with the chimpanzees, Dian Fossey with the
### gorillas, and Birute Galdakis with the orangutans.
### It was the great biologist Carolus Linnaeus who gave the primates
### their name, to indicate that animals of this order were the most
### advanced of all. Linnaeus listed human beings with the apes a
### hundred years before Charles Darwin would publish his famous work
### on evolution. When people told him that our close relationship to the
### apes and monkeys was impossible because it disagreed with the
### Bible, he responded that, from the biological evidence, he simply
### couldn't come to a different conclusion. Among the mammals, the
### primates are distinguished by their large brains, weak sense of
### smell, lack of claws, long pregnancies, and long childhoods, among
### other things. Along with the apes and monkey, the Primate order
### includes such interesting animals as the lemurs, tarsiers, galagos,
### and lorises.

### primordial
### (1) First created or developed. (2)
### Existing in or from the very beginning.
### • Many astronomers think the universe is continuing to evolve from a
### primordial cloud of gas.
### Primordial can be traced back to the Latin word primordium, or
### “origin,” and applies to something that is only the starting point in a
### course of development or progression. A primordial landscape is one
### that bears no sign of human use, and a primordial cell is the first
### formed and least specialized in a line of cells. The substance out of
### which the earth was formed and from which all life evolved is
### commonly called “the primordial ooze” or “the primordial soup”—
### even by scientists.

### HOM/HOMO
### comes from homos, the Greek word for “same,” which
### in English words may also mean “similar.” A homograph is a word
### spelled like another word but different in meaning or pronunciation,
### and a homosexual is a person who favors others of the same sex.
### (This root has nothing to do with the Latin homo, meaning “person,”
### as in Homo sapiens, the French homme, and the Spanish hombre.)

### homonym
### One of two or more words pronounced
### and/or spelled alike but different in meaning.
### • The pool of “a pool of water” and the pool of “a game of pool” are
### homonyms.
### Homonym can be troublesome because it may refer to three distinct
### classes of words. Homonyms may be words with identical
### pronunciations but different spellings and meanings, such as to, too,
### and two. Or they may be words with both identical pronunciations
### and identical spellings but different meanings, such as quail (the
### bird) and quail (to cringe). Finally, they may be words that are
### spelled alike but are different in pronunciation and meaning, such as
### the bow of a ship and bow that shoots arrows. The first and second
### types are sometimes called homophones, and the second and third
### types are sometimes called homographs—which makes naming the
### second type a bit confusing. Some language scholars prefer to limit
### homonym to the third type.

### homogeneous
### (1) Of the same or a similar
### kind. (2) Of uniform structure or composition throughout.
### • Though she was raised in a small town, she found the city more
### interesting because its population was less homogeneous.
### A slab of rock is homogeneous if it consists of the same material
### throughout, like granite or marble. A neighborhood might be called
### homogeneous if all the people in it are similar, having pretty much
### the same background, education, and outlook. Homogeneity is fine
### in a rock, though some people find it a little boring in a
### neighborhood (while others find it comforting). Note that many
### people spell this word homogenous, and pronounce it that way too.

### homologous
### Developing from the same or a
### similar part of a remote ancestor.
### • Arms and wings are homologous structures that reveal the ancient
### relationship between birds and four-legged animals.
### In his famous discussion of the panda's thumb, Stephen Jay Gould
### carefully explains how this thumb is not homologous to the human
### thumb. Although the two digits are used in much the same way (the
### panda's thumb is essential for stripping bamboo of its tasty leaves,
### the staple of the panda's diet), the panda's thumb developed from a
### bone in its wrist and is an addition to the five “fingers” of its paw.
### The tiny stirrup and anvil bones of our inner ear, however, do seem
### to be homologous with the bones that allow a garter snake to
### swallow a frog whole.

### homogenize
### (1) To treat (milk) so that the fat is
### mixed throughout instead of floating on top. (2) To change
### (something) so that its parts are the same or similar.
### • By now the suburb had gotten so homogenized that he couldn't tell
### the families on his street apart.
### Homogenized milk has been around so long—about a hundred years
### —that many Americans have never seen milk with the cream on top,
### and probably think cream separation only happens in expensive
### yogurt. But homogenize was being used before anyone succeeded in
### getting milk and cream to mix. People who use the word often
### dislike the idea that everything is becoming the same, whether it's
### radio shows that are no longer produced locally or schools that rely
### too much on standardized testing.

### DIS
### comes from Latin, where it means “apart.” In English, its
### meanings have increased to include “opposite” or “not” (as in
### distaste, disagreeable), “deprive of” (disinfect), or “exclude or expel
### from” (disbar). The original meaning can still be seen in a word like
### dissipate, which means “to break up and scatter.”

### dissuade
### To convince (someone) not to do something.
### • The thought of the danger he might be facing on the journey
### makes her uneasy, and she's trying to dissuade him from going.
### Dissuade is the opposite of persuade, though it's a less common
### word. The dissuading may be done by a person or by something
### else: A bad weather forecast may dissuade a fisherman from going
### out to sea that day, but a warning on a cigarette pack almost never
### dissuades a real smoker from having his or her next cigarette.

### disorient
### To cause to be confused or lost.
### • By now the hikers were completely disoriented, and darkness was
### falling fast.
### The Orient is the East (just as the Occident is the West). The verb
### orient comes from the traditional practice of building Christian
### churches so that the altar is at the building's easterly end—in other
### words, “orienting” the church. One reason for this practice is that
### the Book of Matthew says, “As the lightning comes from the East . . .
### so also will the Son of Man”—that is, just like the sun in the
### morning, Jesus in his Second Coming will appear in the East.
### Orienteering is participating in a cross-country race in which each
### person uses a map and compass to navigate the course. Orient
### comes from the word meaning “to rise” (like the sun), and still today
### it's easy for a hiker to become disoriented when an overcast sky
### hides the sun.

### discredit
### (1) To cause (someone or something) to
### seem dishonest or untrue. (2) To damage the reputation of
### (someone).
### • His book had been thoroughly discredited by scholars, and his
### reputation was badly damaged.
### Since one meaning of credit is “trust,” discredit means basically
### “destroy one's trust.” A scientific study may be discredited if it turns
### out it was secretly written up by someone paid by a drug company.
### An autobiography may be discredited if someone discovers that the
### best parts came out of a novel. A lawyer may try to discredit
### testimony in a trial by revealing that the witness just got out of the
### slammer. Many political campaigns rely on discrediting one's
### opponents; desperate politicians have learned that, if they can claim
### that someone attacking them has been completely discredited, it
### might work even if it isn't true.

### dislodge
### To force out of a place, especially a place of rest,
### hiding, or defense.
### • Senators are attempting to dislodge the bill from the committee,
### where the chairman has failed to act on it for five months.
### A lodge is usually a kind of roominghouse or hotel, and the verb
### lodge often means staying or sleeping in such a place. Thus,
### dislodge means removing a person or thing from where it's been
### staying. So, for instance, you might use a toothpick to dislodge a
### seed from between your teeth, police might use tear gas to dislodge
### a sniper from his hiding place, and a slate tile dislodged from a roof
### could be dangerous to someone hanging out on the street below.

## Latin Borrowings
### ad hoc
### Formed or used for a particular purpose or for
### immediate needs.
### • The faculty formed an ad hoc committee to deal with the question
### of First Amendment rights on campus.
### Ad hoc literally means “for this” in Latin, and in English this almost
### always means “for this specific purpose.” Issues that come up in the
### course of a project often require immediate, ad hoc solutions. An ad
### hoc investigating committee is authorized to look into a matter of
### limited scope. An ad hoc ruling by an athletic council is intended to
### settle a particular case, and is not meant to serve as a model for
### later rulings. If an organization deals with too many things on an ad
### hoc basis, it may mean someone hasn't been doing enough
### planning.

### ad hominem
### Marked by an attack on an
### opponent's character rather than by an answer to the arguments
### made or the issues raised.
### • Presidential campaigns have often relied on ad hominem attacks
### rather than serious discussion of important issues.
### Ad hominem in Latin means “to the man”—that is, “against the other
### person.” The term comes from the field of rhetoric (the art of
### speaking and writing). If you have a weak argument, one easy way
### to defend yourself has always been to attack your opponent verbally
### in a personal way. Since such attacks require neither truth nor logic
### to be effective, their popularity has never waned.

### alter ego
### (1) A trusted friend or personal
### representative. (2) The opposite side of a personality.
### • The White House chief of staff is a political alter ego, who knows,
### or should know, who and what the President considers most
### important.
### In Latin, alter ego literally means “second I.” An alter ego can be
### thought of as a person's clone or second self. A professional alter
### ego might be a trusted aide who knows exactly what the boss wants
### done. A personal alter ego might be a close friend who is almost like
### a twin. Alter ego can also refer to the second, hidden side of one's
### own self. In Robert Louis Stevenson's classic The Strange Case of
### Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll is a good-hearted, honorable
### man; but after taking a potion, his alter ego, the loathsome and
### diabolical Mr. Hyde, takes over his personality.

### de facto
### Being such in practice or effect, although not
### formally recognized; actual.
### • Although there was never a general declaration of war, the two
### countries were at war in a de facto sense for almost a decade.
### Literally meaning “from the fact,” de facto in English can be applied
### to anything that has the substance of something without its formal
### name. A de facto government is one that operates with all of the
### power of a regular government but without official recognition. De
### facto segregation isn't the result of laws, but can be just as real and
### deep-rooted as legally enforced segregation. The de facto leader of
### a group is just the one who all the rest seem to follow. (Compare
### de
### jure
### .)

### quid pro quo
### Something given or received for
### something else.
### • He did something very nice for me years ago, so getting him that
### job was really a quid pro quo.
### In Latin, quid pro quo means literally “something for something.”
### Originally, the phrase was used to mean the substitution of an
### inferior medicine for a good one. Today it often doesn't suggest
### anything negative; for most people, it just means “a favor for a
### favor.” But in politics the phrase is often used when, for example, a
### wealthy corporation gives a lot of money to a candidate and expects
### to get a big favor in return. In such cases, some of us may prefer to
### describe the money as a bribe and the quid pro quo as a payoff.

### ex post facto
### Done, made, or formulated after
### the fact.
### • When Carl tells us his “reasons” for why he behaved badly, they're
### nothing but ex post facto excuses for impulsive behavior.
### Ex post facto is Latin for “from a thing done afterward.” Approval for
### a project that's given ex post facto—after the project already has
### been begun or completed—may just have been given in order to
### save face. An ex post facto law is one that declares someone's action
### to be criminal only after it was committed—a procedure forbidden by
### our Constitution.

### modus operandi
### A usual way of doing
### something.
### • A criminal who commits repeated crimes can often be identified by
### his modus operandi.
### Modus operandi is Latin for “method of operating.” The term is often
### associated with police work, and it's a favorite of mystery writers. In
### speech and dialogue, it's often abbreviated to “m.o.” (as in “We're
### beginning to get a handle on the killer's m.o., but we can't go public
### with it yet”). But it's not only used in criminal contexts. So a
### frequent gambler who likes to play the horses may have a particular
### modus operandi for picking winners. And the familiar modus
### operandi of a cutthroat retailer may be to undersell competitors,
### drive them out of business, and then raise prices afterwards.

### modus vivendi
### (1) A practical compromise or
### arrangement that is acceptable to all concerned. (2) A way of life.
### • During the budget crisis, the Democratic governor and the
### Republican legislature established a good working modus vivendi.
### Modus vivendi literally means “manner of living” in Latin, and it
### sometimes has that meaning in English as well. Usually, though, a
### modus vivendi is a working arrangement that disputing parties can
### live with, at least until a more permanent solution can be found.
### Typically, a modus vivendi is an arrangement that ignores differences
### and difficulties. So, for example, two people going through a bitter
### divorce may be able to arrive at a modus vivendi that allows them to
### at least maintain an appearance of civility and dignity.
