### HER
### comes from the Latin verb haerere, meaning “to stick.” Another
### form of the verb produces the root hes-, seen in such words as
### adhesive, which means basically “sticky” or “sticking,” and hesitate,
### which means more or less “stuck in one place.”

### adherent
### (1) Someone who follows a leader, a party,
### or a profession. (2) One who believes in a particular philosophy or
### religion.
### • The general's adherents heavily outnumbered his opponents and
### managed to shout them down repeatedly.
### Just as tape adheres to paper, a person may adhere to a cause, a
### faith, or a belief. Thus, you may be an adherent of Hinduism, an
### adherent of environmentalism, or an adherent of the Republican
### Party. A plan for cutting taxes always attracts adherents easily,
### regardless of what the cuts may result in.

### cohere
### To hold together firmly as parts of the same mass.
### • His novels never really cohere; the chapters always seem like
### separate short stories.
### When you finish writing a paper, you may feel that it coheres well,
### since it's sharply focused and all the ideas seem to support each
### other. When all the soldiers in an army platoon feel like buddies, the
### platoon has become a cohesive unit. In science class you may learn
### the difference between cohesion (the tendency of a chemical's
### molecules to stick together) and adhesion (the tendency of the
### molecules of two different substances to stick together). Water
### molecules tend to cohere, so water falls from the sky in drops, not
### as separate molecules. But water molecules also adhere to
### molecules of other substances, so raindrops will often cling to the
### underside of a clothesline for a while before gravity pulls them
### down.

### incoherent
### (1) Unclear or difficult to understand.
### (2) Loosely organized or inconsistent.
### • The police had found him in an abandoned warehouse, and they
### reported that he was dirty, hungry, and incoherent.
### Incoherent is the opposite of coherent, and both commonly refer to
### words and thoughts. Just as coherent means well ordered and clear,
### incoherent means disordered and hard to follow. Incoherence in
### speech may result from emotional stress, especially anxiety or anger.
### Incoherence in writing may simply result from poor planning; a
### twelve-page term paper that isn't written until the night before it's
### due will generally suffer from incoherence.

### inherent
### Part of something by nature or habit.
### • A guiding belief behind our Constitution is that individuals have
### certain inherent rights that can't be taken away.
### Inherent literally refers to something that is “stuck in” something
### else so firmly that they can't be separated. A plan may have an
### inherent flaw that will cause it to fail; a person may have inherent
### virtues that everyone admires. Since the flaw and the virtues can't
### be removed, the plan may simply have to be thrown out and the
### person will remain virtuous forever.

### FUG
### comes from the Latin verb fugere, meaning “to flee or escape.”
### Thus, a refugee flees from some threat or danger, while a fugitive is
### usually fleeing from the law.

### centrifugal
### Moving outward from a center or
### central focus.
### • Their favorite carnival ride was the Round-up, in which centrifugal
### force flattened them against the outer wall of a rapidly spinning
### cage.
### Centrifugal force is what keeps a string with a ball on the end taut
### when you whirl it around. A centrifuge is a machine that uses
### centrifugal force. At the end of a washing machine's cycle, it
### becomes a weak and simple centrifuge as it whirls the water out of
### your clothes. Centrifuges hundreds of thousands of times as
### powerful
### are
### essential
### to
### nuclear
### technology
### and
### drug
### manufacturing. Part of an astronaut's training occurs in a centrifuge
### that generates force equal to several times the force of gravity
### (about like a washing machine) to get them used to the forces they'll
### encounter in a real space mission.

### refuge
### Shelter or protection from danger or distress, or a
### place that provides shelter or protection.
### • Caught in a storm by surprise, they took refuge in an abandoned
### barn.
### The re- in refuge means basically “back” or “backward” rather than
### “again” (see
### RE-
### ); thus, a refugee is someone who is “fleeing
### backward.” Refuge tends to appear with certain other words: you
### generally “seek refuge,” “take refuge,” or “find refuge.” Religion may
### be a refuge from the woes of your life; a beautiful park may be a
### refuge from the noise of the city; and your bedroom may be a
### refuge from the madness of your family.

### fugue
### A musical form in which a theme is echoed and
### imitated by voices or instruments that enter one after another and
### interweave as the piece proceeds.
### • For his debut on the church's new organ, the organist chose a
### fugue by J. S. Bach.
### Bach and Handel composed many fugues for harpsichord and organ
### in which the various parts (or voices) seem to flee from and chase
### each other in an intricate dance. Each part, after it has stated the
### theme or melody, apparently flees from the next part, which takes
### up the same theme and sets off in pursuit. Simple rounds such as
### “Three Blind Mice” or “Row, Row, Row Your Boat” could be called
### fugues for children, but a true fugue can be long and extremely
### complex.

### subterfuge
### (1) A trick designed to help conceal,
### escape, or evade. (2) A deceptive trick.
### • The conservatives' subterfuge of funding a liberal third-party
### candidate in order to take votes away from the main liberal
### candidate almost worked that year.
### With its “flee” root, the Latin verb subterfugere meant “to escape or
### avoid.” Thus, a subterfuge is a way of escaping blame,
### embarrassment, inconvenience—or even prison—by tricky means.
### The life of spies consists of an endless series of subterfuges. In the
### more everyday world, putting words like “heart-healthy” on junk-
### food packaging is a subterfuge to trick unwary shoppers. And getting
### a friend to call about an “emergency” in order to get out of an
### evening engagement is about the oldest subterfuge in the book.

### COSM
### comes from the Greek word for “order.” Since the Greeks
### believed the universe was an orderly place, words in this group
### usually relate to the universe. So cosmonaut was the word for a
### space traveler from the former Soviet Union. (The roots of our own
### word, astronaut, suggest “star traveler” instead.) Oddly enough,
### cosmetics comes from the same root, since putting things in order is
### similar to decorating something—such as your face.

### cosmos
### (1) The universe, especially when it is viewed
### as orderly and systematic. (2) Any orderly system that is complete in
### itself.
### • The astronomer, the biologist, and the philosopher all try in their
### own ways to make sense of the cosmos.
### Cosmos often simply means “universe.” But the word is generally
### used to suggest an orderly or harmonious universe, as it was
### originally used by Pythagoras in the 6th century B.C. Thus, a
### religious mystic may help put us in touch with the cosmos, and so
### may a physicist. The same is often true of the adjective cosmic:
### Cosmic rays (really particles rather than rays) bombard us from
### outer space, but cosmic questions come from human attempts to
### find order in the universe.

### cosmology
### (1) A theory that describes the nature
### of the universe. (2) A branch of astronomy that deals with the origin
### and structure of the universe.
### • New Age teachers propose a cosmology quite unlike the traditional
### Jewish, Christian, or Islamic ways of viewing the universe.
### Most religions and cultures include some kind of cosmology to
### explain the nature of the universe. In modern astronomy, the leading
### cosmology is still the Big Bang theory, which claims that the universe
### began with a huge explosion that sent matter and energy spreading
### out in all directions. One reason why fans watch Star Trek is for the
### various cosmologies depicted in the show, including different
### conceptions of space, time, and the meaning of life.

### microcosm
### Something (such as a place or an
### event) that is seen as a small version of something much larger.
### • The large hippie communes of the 1960s and '70s were
### microcosms of socialist systems, with most of socialism's advantages
### and disadvantages.
### A troubled urban school can look like a microcosm of America's
### educational system. A company's problems may be so typical that
### they can represent an entire small country's economic woes “in
### microcosm.” Microcosm, and especially its synonym microcosmos,
### are also sometimes used when talking about the microscopic world.
### The documentary film Microcosmos is devoted to the remarkable
### insect life in an ordinary meadow on a single summer's day.

### cosmopolitan
### (1)
### Having
### international
### sophistication and experience. (2) Made up of persons, elements, or
### influences from many different parts of the world.
### • New York, like most cosmopolitan cities, offers a wonderful array of
### restaurants featuring foods from around the world.
### Since cosmopolitan includes the root polit-, from the Greek word for
### “citizen”, someone who is cosmopolitan is a “citizen of the world.”
### She may be able to read the morning paper in Rio de Janeiro, attend
### a lecture in Madrid, and assist at a refugee camp in Uganda with
### equal ease—and maybe all in the same week. And a city or a
### country that is cosmopolitan has aspects and elements that come
### from various countries.

### SCI
### comes from the Latin verb scire, “to know” or “to understand.”
### The root appears in such common words as science, which originally
### meant simply “knowledge,” and conscience, meaning “moral
### knowledge.” And to be conscious is to be in a state where you are
### able to know or understand.

### conscientious
### (1) Governed by morality;
### scrupulous. (2) Resulting from painstaking or exact attention.
### • New employees should be especially conscientious about turning in
### all their assignments on time.
### Conscience and its adjective conscientious both come from a Latin
### verb meaning “to be aware of guilt.” Conscientious indicates extreme
### care, either in observing moral laws or in performing assigned
### duties. A conscientious person is someone with a strong moral
### sense, who has feelings of guilt when he or she violates it. A
### conscientious worker has a sense of duty that forces him or her to
### do a careful job. A conscientious report shows painstaking work on
### the part of the writer. And a conscientious objector is someone who,
### for reasons of conscience, refuses to fight in an army.

### nescience
### Lack of knowledge or awareness: ignorance.
### • About once every class period, my political-science professor would
### angrily denounce the nescience of the American public.
### This word, which means literally “non-knowledge,” is only used by
### intellectuals, and the same is true of its adjective, nescient. We all
### have heard the remarkable facts: 40% of us believe that humans
### and dinosaurs lived on earth at the same time; 49% believe that the
### President can ignore the Constitution; 60% can't name the three
### branches of government; 75% can't find Israel on a map; and so on.
### Is it any wonder we Americans are sometimes called nescient?

### prescient
### Having or showing advance knowledge of
### what is going to happen.
### • For years she had read the Wall Street Journal every morning,
### looking for prescient warnings about crashes, crises, and
### catastrophes on the horizon.
### Being truly prescient would require supernatural powers. But well-
### informed people may have such good judgment as to appear
### prescient, and prescient is often used to mean “having good
### foresight.” Some newspaper columnists may seem prescient in their
### predictions, but we can't help suspecting that any apparent
### prescience is usually the result of leaks from people with inside
### knowledge.

### unconscionable
### (1) Not guided by any moral
### sense; unscrupulous. (2) Shockingly excessive, unreasonable, or
### unfair.
### • When the facts about how the cigarette industry had lied about its
### practices for decades finally came out, most Americans found the
### behavior unconscionable.
### Something that can't be done in good conscience is unconscionable,
### and such acts can range from betraying a confidence to mass
### murder. For a five-syllable word, unconscionable is actually quite
### common. This is partly because it isn't always used very seriously;
### so, for example, a critic is free to call a fat new book “an
### unconscionable waste of trees.” In law, an unconscionable contract is
### one that, even though it was signed by both parties, is so ridiculous
### that a judge will just throw it out.

### JUNCT
### comes from the Latin verb jungere, meaning “to join.” A
### junction is a place where roads or railways come together. A
### conjunction is a word that joins two other words or groups of words:
### “this and that,” “to be or not to be.”

### juncture
### (1) An important point in a process or activity.
### (2) A place where things join: junction.
### • The architect claims his design for the new Islamic Museum
### represents a juncture of Muslim and Western culture.
### The meaning of juncture can be entirely physical; thus, you can
### speak of the juncture of the turnpike and Route 116, or the juncture
### of the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers. But it more often means
### something nonphysical. This may be a moment in time, especially a
### moment when important events are “crossing” (“At this critical
### juncture, the President called together his top security advisers”).
### But juncture also often refers to the coming together of two or more
### ideas, systems, styles, or fields (“These churches seem to operate at
### the juncture of religion and patriotism,” “Her job is at the juncture of
### product design and marketing,” etc.).

### adjunct
### Something joined or added to another thing of
### which it is not a part.
### • All technical-school students learn that classroom instruction can
### be a valuable adjunct to hands-on training.
### With its prefix, ad-, meaning “to or toward,” adjunct implies that one
### thing is “joined to” another. A car wash may be operated as an
### adjunct to a gas station. An adjunct professor is one who's attached
### to the college without being a full member of the salaried faculty.
### And anyone trying to expand his or her vocabulary will find that daily
### reading of a newspaper is a worthwhile adjunct to actual vocabulary
### study.

### disjunction
### A break, separation, or sharp
### difference between two things.
### • By now she realized there was a serious disjunction between the
### accounts of his personal life that his two best friends were giving
### her.
### A disjunction may be a mere lack of connection between two things,
### or a large gulf. There's often a huge disjunction between what
### people expect from computers and what they know about them, and
### the disjunction between a star's public image and her actual
### character may be just as big. We may speak of the disjunction
### between science and morality, between doing and telling, or
### between knowing and explaining. In recent years, disjunction seem
### to have been losing out to a newer synonym, the noun disconnect.

### conjunct
### Bound together; joined, united.
### • Politics and religion were conjunct in 18th-century England, and
### the American colonists were intent on separating the two.
### With its prefix con-, meaning “with, together,” conjunct means
### basically “joined together.” A rather intellectual word, it has special
### meanings in music (referring to a smooth melodic line that doesn't
### skip up or down) and astronomy (referring to two stars or planets
### that appear next to each other), but its more general “bound
### together” meaning is rarer. A conjunction is a word (particularly and,
### or, or but) that joins together words or groups of words, and an
### adverb that joins two clauses or sentences (such as so, however,
### meanwhile, therefore, or also) is called a conjunctive adverb—or
### simply a conjunct.

### PART
### , from the Latin word pars, meaning “part,” comes into English
### most obviously in our word part. An apartment or compartment is
### part of a larger whole. The same is usually true of a particle.

### bipartite
### (1) Being in two parts. (2) Shared by two.
### • The report is a bipartite document, and all the important findings
### are in the second section.
### Usually a technical word, bipartite is common in medicine and
### biology. A bipartite patella, for example, is a split kneecap; many
### people are born with them. Many creatures have a bipartite life
### cycle, living life in two very distinct forms. As one example, the
### velella begins life as a creature that travels with thousands of others
### in the form of a kind of sailboat, blown across the ocean's surface
### with the wind; only later does each velella turn into a tiny jellyfish.

### impartial
### Fair and not biased; treating or affecting all
### equally.
### • Representatives of labor and management agreed to have the
### matter decided by an impartial third party.
### To be “partial to” or “partial toward” someone or something is to be
### somewhat biased or prejudiced, which means that a person who is
### partial really only sees part of the whole picture. To be impartial is
### the opposite. The United Nations sends impartial observers to
### monitor elections in troubled countries. We hope judges and juries
### will be impartial when they hand down verdicts. But grandparents
### aren't expected to be impartial when describing their new
### grandchild.

### participle
### A word that is formed from a verb but
### used like an adjective.
### • In the phrase “the crying child,”“crying” is a present participle; in
### “satisfaction guaranteed,” “guaranteed” is a past participle.
### English verbs can take several basic forms, which we call their
### principal parts: the infinitive (“to move,” “to speak,” etc.), the past
### tense (“moved,” “spoke”), the past participle (“moved,” “spoken”),
### and the present participle (“moving,” “speaking”). The participles are
### words that “take part” in two different word classes: that is, verb
### forms that can also act like adjectives (“the spoken word,” “a moving
### experience”). A grammatical error called a dangling participle occurs
### when a sentence begins with a participle that doesn't modify the
### subject; in the sentence “Climbing the mountain, the cabin came in
### view,” for example, “climbing” is a dangling participle since it doesn't
### modify “cabin.”

### partisan
### (1) A person who is strongly devoted to a
### particular cause or group. (2) A guerrilla fighter.
### • Throughout his career on the Supreme Court, he had been a
### forthright partisan of the cause of free speech.
### A partisan is someone who supports one part or party. Sometimes
### the support takes the form of military action, as when guerrilla
### fighters take on government forces. But partisan is actually most
### often used as an adjective, usually referring to support of a political
### party. so if you're accused of being too partisan, or of practicing
### partisan politics, it means you're mainly interested in boosting your
### own party and attacking the other one.

### MIS
### comes from the Latin verb mittere, “to send.” A missile is
### something sent speeding through the air or water. And when your
### class is dismissed at the end of the day, you're sent home.

### mission
### (1) A task that someone is given to do,
### especially a military task. (2) A task that someone considers an
### important duty.
### • She considers it her mission to prevent unwanted puppies and
### kittens from being born.
### Your own mission in life can be anything you pursue with almost
### religious enthusiasm. People with a mission—whether it's stopping
### drunk driving, keeping the town's public areas clean, increasing local
### recycling, or building a community center—very often succeed in
### really changing things.

### missionary
### A person undertaking a mission, and
### especially a religious missionary.
### • North American missionaries have been working in Central America
### for decades, and you can find their churches in even the most
### remote jungle regions.
### Beginning around 1540, an order of Catholic priests known as the
### Jesuits began to send its members to many parts of the world to
### convert peoples who believed in other gods to Christianity. Wherever
### they went, the Catholic missionaries built central buildings for their
### religious work, and the buildings themselves became known as
### missions; many 17th-century missions in the American West and
### Southwest are now preserved as museums. Their foes, the
### Protestants, soon began sending out their own missionaries, and
### today Protestant missionaries are probably far more numerous.

### emissary
### Someone sent out to represent another;
### an agent.
### • Now in his 70s, he had served over many years as a presidential
### emissary to many troubled regions of the world .
### Like missionaries, emissaries are sent on missions. However,
### emissaries are more likely to be representing governments, political
### leaders, and nonreligious institutions, and an emissary's mission is
### usually to negotiate or to gather information. So a president may
### send a trusted emissary to a war-torn region to discuss peace terms.
### A company's CEO may send an emissary to check out another
### company that they may be thinking of buying. And a politician may
### send out an emissary to persuade a wealthy individual to become a
### supporter.

### transmission
### (1) The act or process of sending
### something from one point to another, especially sending electrical
### signals to a radio, television, computer, etc. (2) The gears by which
### the power is passed from the engine to the axle in a motor vehicle.
### • Even in the Middle Ages, transmission of news of a ruler's death
### across the Asian continent could be accomplished by sun reflectors
### within 24 hours.
### Since trans- means “across” (see
### TRANS
### ), it's not hard to see the
### meaning of transmission. Disease transmission occurs when an
### infection passes from one living thing to another. TV signal
### transmission can be interrupted by tree leaves, including moving
### leaves and branches during a storm. Your car's transmission
### transmits the engine's power to the axle, changing the gears to keep
### the engine working with maximum efficiency at various speeds.

### PEL
### comes from the Latin verb pellere, meaning “to move or drive.”
### So a propeller moves a small airplane forward. And if you dispel
### someone's fears, you “drive them away.”

### compel
### (1) To force (someone) to do something. (2) To
### make (something) happen.
### • After returning from the lecture, they felt compelled to contribute
### to one of the refugee relief agencies.
### The prefix com- acts as a strengthener in this word; thus, to compel
### is to drive powerfully, or force. So you may feel compelled to speak
### to a friend about his drinking, or compelled to reveal a secret in
### order to prevent something from happening. A compulsion is usually
### a powerful inner urge; a compulsive shopper or a compulsive
### gambler usually can't hold onto money for long. You might not want
### to do something unless there's a compelling reason; however, a
### compelling film is simply one that seems serious and important.

### expel
### (1) To drive or force out. (2) To force to leave,
### usually by official action.
### • For repeatedly ignoring important agreements over several years,
### the two countries were eventually expelled from the trade
### organization.
### To expel is to drive out, and its usual noun is expulsion. Expel is
### similar to eject, but expel suggests pushing out while eject suggests
### throwing out. Also, ejecting may only be temporary: the player
### ejected from a game may be back tomorrow, but the student
### expelled from school is probably out forever.

### impel
### To urge or drive forward by strong moral force.
### • As the meeting wore on without any real progress being made, she
### felt impelled to stand and speak.
### Impel is very similar in meaning to compel, and often a perfect
### synonym, though it tends to suggest even more strongly an inner
### drive to do something and a greater urgency to act, especially for
### moral reasons. But when impel takes its noun and adjective forms, it
### changes slightly. So an impulse—such as “impulse buying,” when you
### suddenly see something cool and know you've got to have it—often
### isn't based on anything very serious. And impulsive behavior in
### general, such as blurting out something stupid on the spur of the
### moment, is the kind of thing you're supposed to get over when you
### grow up.

### repel
### (1) To keep (something) out or away. (2) To drive
### back.
### • Her son, knowing how she was repelled by rats and snakes, had
### started keeping them in his bedroom.
### Since re- can mean not just “again” but also “back” (see
### RE-
### ), repel
### means “drive back.” Repel has two common adjective forms; thus, a
### repellent or repulsive odor may drive us into the other room. Its
### main noun form is repulsion. Magnets exhibit both attraction and
### repulsion, and the goal of an armed defense is the repulsion of an
### enemy; but we generally use repulsion to mean “strong dislike.” In
### recent years, repulse has been increasingly used as a synonym for
### repel (“That guy repulses me”).

## Words from Mythology
### arachnid
### A member of the class Arachnida, which
### principally includes animals with four pairs of legs and no antennae,
### such as spiders, scorpions, mites, and ticks.
### • His interest in arachnids began when, as a child, he would watch
### spiders build their gorgeous webs in the corners of the porch.
### The Greek word for “spider” is arachne, and, according to Greek
### mythology, the original arachnid was a girl named Arachne. A
### marvelous weaver, she made the mistake of claiming she was better
### at her craft than the goddess Athena. In a contest between the two,
### she angered the goddess by weaving a remarkable tapestry showing
### the gods behaving badly. As punishment, Athena changed Arachne
### into a spider, fated to spend her life weaving. With their eight legs,
### arachnids are easily distinguished from the six-legged insects, on
### which they feed by injecting digesting juices and then sucking up the
### liquefied remains.

### calliope
### A musical instrument similar to an organ in
### which whistles are sounded by steam or compressed air.
### • The town's old calliope, with its unmistakable sound, summoned
### them to the fair every summer.
### To the ancient Greeks, the Muses were nine goddesses, each of
### whom was the spirit of one or more of the arts and sciences.
### Calliope was the Muse of heroic or epic poetry, who inspired poets to
### write such epics as the Iliad and the Odyssey. Since the lengthy
### epics were generally sung from beginning to end, she was
### responsible for a great deal of musical reciting. But she wouldn't
### necessarily have approved of having her name used for the hooting
### organlike instrument that was invented in America around 1855.
### Calliopes gave a festive air to the great showboats that floated up
### and down the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers giving theatrical
### performances; the loudest could supposedly be heard eight miles
### away, attracting customers from all around. Today they are mostly
### heard on merry-go-rounds and at circuses.

### dryad
### A wood nymph.
### • The ancient Greeks' love of trees can be seen in their belief that
### every tree contained a dryad, which died when the tree was cut.
### The term dryad comes from the Greek word for “oak tree.” As the
### Greeks saw it, every tree (not only oaks) had a spirit. The best
### known of the dryads was Daphne. The beautiful daughter of a river
### god, she was desired by the god Apollo; as he was about to capture
### her, she prayed to her father to save her, and he transformed her
### into a laurel tree. In her honor, Apollo commanded that the poet
### who won the highest prize every year be crowned with a laurel
### wreath. The Greeks' respect for trees unfortunately failed to keep
### Greece's forests from shrinking greatly over the centuries, and those
### that remain produce little wood of good quality.

### fauna
### Animal life, especially the animals that live naturally
### in a given area or environment.
### • The larger fauna of the county include coyotes, black bear, deer,
### moose, wild turkey, hawks, and vultures.
### Faunus and Fauna were the Roman woodland god and goddess for
### whom animals were a particular concern. Faunus was the Roman
### equivalent of the Greek god Pan, and like Pan, he had goats' legs.
### Their goat-legged helpers, called fauns, were known for their love of
### pleasure and mischief. The fauna of a continent are often very
### similar across a broad east-west band; from north to south, however,
### they may vary greatly.

### flora
### Plant life, especially the flowering plants that live
### naturally in a specific area or environment.
### • Scientists are busily identifying the flora of the Amazon rain forest
### before the rapid expansion of commercial interests consumes it.
### Flora means “flower” in Latin, and Flora was the Roman goddess of
### spring and flowering plants, especially wildflowers and plants not
### raised for food. She was shown as a beautiful young woman in a
### long, flowing dress with flowers in her hair, strewing flowers over the
### earth. English preserves her name in such words as floral, floret, and
### flourish. A region's flora may range from tiny violets to towering
### trees. The common phrase “flora and fauna” covers just about every
### visible living thing.

### herculean
### (1) Extremely strong. (2) Extremely
### extensive, intense, or difficult.
### • Accomplishing all the things he promised during the presidential
### campaign will be a herculean task.
### The hero Hercules, son of the god Zeus by a human mother, was
### famous for his superhuman strength. To pacify the wrath of the god
### Apollo, he was forced to perform twelve enormously difficult tasks,
### or “labors.” These ranged from descending into the underworld to
### bring back the terrifying dog that guarded its entrance to destroying
### the many-headed monster called the Hydra. Any job or task that's
### extremely difficult or calls for enormous strength is therefore called
### herculean.

### Pandora's box
### A source of many troubles.
### • In a thundering speech, he predicted that, if the bill was passed,
### the new policy would open a Pandora's box of economic problems.
### The god Prometheus stole fire from heaven to give to the human
### race, which originally consisted only of men. To punish humanity, the
### other gods created the first woman, the beautiful Pandora. As a gift,
### Zeus gave her a box, which she was told never to open. However, as
### soon as he was out of sight she took off the lid, and out swarmed all
### the troubles of the world, never to be recaptured. Only Hope was
### left in the box, stuck under the lid. Anything that looks ordinary but
### may produce unpredictable harmful results can thus be called a
### Pandora's box.

### Scylla
### and
### Charybdis
### Two
### equally
### dangerous alternatives.
### • Doctors and patients who need to calculate the ideal dosage of the
### medication, knowing how it can trigger a different dangerous
### condition, often feel caught between Scylla and Charybdis.
### The Strait of Messina is the narrow passage between the island of
### Sicily and the “toe” of Italy's “boot.” In Greek mythology, two
### monsters hovered on either side of the strait. Scylla, a female
### monster with six snake-like heads, each with pointed teeth, barked
### like a dog from the rocks on the Italian side. Charybdis, on the
### Sicilian side, caused a whirlpool by swallowing the waters of the sea
### three times a day. When Odysseus attempted to sail between them,
### he encountered disaster on both sides. Being caught between Scylla
### and Charybdis is a lot like being between a rock and a hard place.
