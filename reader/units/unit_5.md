### MAL
### comes from a Latin word meaning “bad.” A malady is a bad
### condition—a disease or illness—of the body or mind. Malpractice is
### bad medical practice. Malodorous things smell bad. And a malefactor
### is someone guilty of bad deeds.

### malevolent
### Having or showing intense ill will or
### hatred.
### • Captain Ahab sees Moby Dick not simply as a whale but as a
### powerfully malevolent foe.
### Malevolence runs deep. Malevolent enemies have bitter and lasting
### feelings of ill will. Malevolent racism and bigotry can erupt in acts of
### violence against innocent people. Malevolence can also show itself in
### hurtful words, and can sometimes be seen in something as small as
### an angry look or gesture.

### malicious
### Desiring to cause pain, injury, or distress to
### another.
### • The boys didn't take the apples with any malicious intent; they
### were just hungry and didn't know any better.
### Malicious and malevolent are close in meaning, since both refer to ill
### will that desires to see someone else suffer. But while malevolent
### suggests deep and lasting dislike, malicious usually means petty and
### spiteful. Malicious gossipers are often simply envious of a neighbor's
### good fortune. Vandals may take malicious pleasure in destroying and
### defacing property but usually don't truly hate the owners. Malice is
### an important legal concept, which has to be proved in order to
### convict someone of certain crimes such as first-degree murder.

### malign
### To make harsh and often false or misleading
### statements about.
### • Captain Bligh of the Bounty may be one of the most unjustly
### maligned figures in British naval history.
### Malign is related to verbs like defame, slander, and libel. The person
### or group being maligned is the victim of false or misleading
### statements, even if the maligner isn't necessarily guilty of deliberate
### lying. Someone or something that's frequently criticized is often said
### to be “much maligned,” which suggests that the criticism isn't
### entirely fair or deserved. Malign is also an adjective, and writers
### often refer to a person's malign influence. The very similar
### malignant, which used to be a common synonym of malign, today
### tends to describe dangerous medical conditions, especially cancerous
### tumors.

### malnourished
### Badly or poorly nourished.
### • When they finally found the children in the locked cabin, they were
### pale and malnourished but unharmed.
### Malnourished people can be found in all types of societies. Famine
### and poverty are only two of the common causes of malnutrition. In
### wealthier societies, malnutrition is often the result of poor eating
### habits. Any diet that fails to provide the nutrients needed for health
### and growth can lead to malnutrition, and some malnourished people
### are actually fat.

### CATA
### comes from the Greek kata, one of whose meanings was
### “down.” A catalogue is a list of items put down on paper, and a
### catapult is a weapon for hurling missiles down on one's enemies.

### cataclysm
### (1) A violent and massive change of the
### earth's surface. (2) A momentous event that results in great
### upheaval and often destruction.
### • World War I was a great cataclysm in modern history, marking the
### end of the old European social and political order.
### The -clysm part of cataclysm comes from the Greek word meaning
### “to wash,” so cataclysm's original meaning was “flood, deluge,” and
### especially Noah's Flood itself. A cataclysm causes great and lasting
### changes. An earthquake or other natural disaster that changes the
### landscape is one kind of cataclysm, but a violent political revolution
### may also be a cataclysmic event. Many cataclysms could instead be
### called catastrophes.

### catacomb
### An underground cemetery of connecting
### passageways with recesses for tombs.
### • The early Christian catacombs of Rome provide a striking glimpse
### into the ancient past for modern-day visitors.
### About forty Christian catacombs have been found near the roads
### that once led into Rome. After the decline of the Roman empire
### these cemeteries were forgotten, not to be rediscovered until 1578.
### Catacomb has come to refer to different kinds of underground
### chambers and passageways. The catacombs of Paris are abandoned
### stone quarries that were not used for burials until 1787. The
### catacombs built by a monastery in Palermo, Sicily, for its deceased
### members later began accepting bodies from outside the monastery;
### today you may wander through looking at hundreds of mummified
### corpses propped against the catacomb walls, dressed in tattered
### clothes that were once fashionable.

### catalyst
### (1) A substance that speeds up a chemical
### reaction or lets it take place under different conditions. (2) Someone
### or something that brings about or speeds significant change or
### action.
### • The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914
### turned out to be the catalyst for World War I.
### Chemical catalysts are substances that, in very small amounts, can
### bring about important chemical changes in large quantities of
### material. The catalytic converter in your car's exhaust system, for
### instance, uses tiny amounts of platinum to swiftly convert the
### engine's dangerous gases to carbon dioxide and water vapor. And it's
### easy to see how the meaning of catalyst could broaden to include
### nonchemical situations. We can now say, for example, that the Great
### Depression served as the catalyst for such important social reforms
### as Social Security.

### catatonic
### (1) Relating to or suffering from a form of
### schizophrenia. (2) Showing an unusual lack of movement, activity, or
### expression.
### • After an hour, extreme boredom had produced a catatonic stupor
### in those of the audience who were still awake.
### Catatonia is primarily a form of the terrible mental disease known as
### schizophrenia, though it may show up in patients with a variety of
### other mental conditions. A common symptom is extreme muscular
### rigidity; catatonic patients may be “frozen” for hours or even days in
### a single position. Its causes remain mysterious. Serious though the
### condition is, most nondoctors use catatonic humorously to describe
### people who seem incapable of moving or changing expression.

### PROT/PROTO
### comes from Greek and has the basic meaning “first
### in time” or “first formed.” Protozoa are one-celled animals, such as
### amoebas and paramecia, that are among the most basic members of
### the biological kingdom. A proton is an elementary particle that,
### along with neutrons, can be found in all atomic nuclei. A protoplanet
### is a whirling mass of gas and dust that astronomers believe may
### someday become a planet.

### protagonist
### The main character in a literary work.
### • Macbeth is the ruthlessly ambitious protagonist of Shakespeare's
### play, but it is his wife who pulls the strings.
### Struggle, or conflict, is central to drama. The protagonist or hero of
### a play, novel, or film is involved in a struggle of some kind, either
### against someone or something else or even against his or her own
### emotions. So the hero is the “first struggler,” which is the literal
### meaning of the Greek word pr
### tag
### nist
### s. A character who opposes
### the hero is the antagonist, from a Greek verb that means literally “to
### struggle against.”

### protocol
### (1) A code of diplomatic or military rules of
### behavior. (2) A set of rules for the formatting of data in an electronic
### communications system.
### • The guests at the governor's dinner were introduced and seated
### according to the strict protocol governing such occasions.
### The basic meaning of proto- is a little harder to follow in this word.
### Protocol comes from a Greek word for the first sheet of a papyrus
### roll. In English, protocol originally meant “a first draft or record,” and
### later specifically the first draft of a diplomatic document, such as a
### treaty. The “diplomatic” connection led eventually to its current
### meaning of “rules of behavior.” Someone wearing Bermuda shorts
### and sandals to a state dinner at the White House would not be
### acting “according to protocol,” and royal protocol forbids touching
### the queen of England except to shake her hand. But protocol is also
### now used for other sets of rules, such as those for doing a scientific
### experiment or for handling computer data.

### protoplasm
### The substance that makes up the
### living parts of cells.
### • A mixture of organic and inorganic substances, such as protein and
### water, protoplasm is regarded as the physical basis of life.
### After the word protoplasm was coined in the mid-19th century for
### the jellylike material that is the main substance of a cell, it began to
### be used widely, especially by scientists and others who imagined
### that the first life-forms must have arisen out of a great seething
### protoplasmic soup. Since protoplasm includes all the cell's living
### material, inside and outside the nucleus, it is a less useful scientific
### word today than more precise terms such as cytoplasm, which refers
### only to the living material outside the nucleus. But many remain
### fascinated by the image of that soup bubbling away as the lightning
### flashes and the volcanoes erupt.

### prototype
### (1) An original model on which something is
### patterned. (2) A first, full-scale, usually working version of a new
### type or design.
### • There was great excitement when, after years of top-secret
### development, the prototype of the new Stealth bomber first took to
### the skies.
### A prototype is someone or something that serves as a model or
### inspiration. A successful fund-raising campaign can serve as a
### prototype for future campaigns, for example, and the legendary
### Robin Hood is the prototypical honorable outlaw, the inspiration for
### countless other romantic heroes. But the term is perhaps most
### widely used in the world of technology; every new “concept car,” for
### example, starts off as a unique prototype.

### ANTE
### is Latin for “before” or “in front of.” Antediluvian, which
### describes something very old or outdated, literally means “before the
### flood”—that is, Noah's Flood. And antebellum literally means “before
### the war,” usually the American Civil War.

### antechamber
### An outer room that leads to
### another and is often used as a waiting room.
### • The antechamber to the lawyer's office was both elegant and
### comfortable, designed to inspire trust and confidence.
### One expects to find an antechamber outside the private chambers of
### a Supreme Court Justice or leading into the great hall of a medieval
### castle. In the private end of the castle the lord's or lady's
### bedchamber would have its own antechamber, which served as a
### dressing room and sitting room, but could also house bodyguards if
### the castle came under siege. Anteroom is a less formal synonym,
### one that's often applied to the waiting rooms of professional offices
### today.

### antedate
### (1) To date something (such as a check) with
### a date earlier than that of actual writing. (2) To precede in time.
### • Nantucket Island has hundreds of beautifully preserved houses
### that antedate the Civil War.
### Dinosaurs antedated the first human beings by almost 65 million
### years, though this stubborn fact never used to stop cartoonists and
### screenwriters from having the two species inhabit the same story
### line. Dictionary editors are constantly noticing how the oral use of a
### word may antedate its first appearance in print by a number of
### years. Antedating a check or a contract isn't illegal unless it's done
### for the purpose of fraud (the same is true of its opposite,
### postdating).

### antecedent
### (1) A word or phrase that is referred
### to by a pronoun that follows it. (2) An event or cause coming before
### something.
### • As I remember, she said “My uncle is taking my father, and he's
### staying overnight,” but I'm not sure what the antecedent of “he”
### was.
### A basic principle of clear writing is to keep your antecedents clear.
### Pronouns are often used in order not to repeat a noun (so instead of
### saying “Sheila turns 22 tomorrow, and Sheila is having a party,” we
### replace the second “Sheila” with “she”). But sloppy writers
### sometimes leave their antecedents unclear (for instance, “Sheila
### helps Kathleen out, but she doesn't appreciate it,” where it isn't clear
### who “she” is). Watch out for this possible problem when using not
### just he and she but also they, them, it, this, and that. And keep in
### mind that antecedent isn't just a grammar term. You may talk about
### the antecedents of heart disease (such as bad eating habits), the
### antecedents of World War II (such as the unwise Treaty of
### Versailles), and even your own antecedents (your mother,
### grandfather, etc.).

### anterior
### (1) Located before or toward the front or
### head. (2) Coming before in time or development.
### • When she moved up to join the first-class passengers in the
### plane's anterior section, she was delighted to recognize the governor
### in the next seat.
### Anterior generally appears in either medical or scholarly contexts.
### Anatomy books refer to the anterior lobe of the brain, the anterior
### cerebral artery, the anterior facial vein, etc. Scholar and lawyers may
### use anterior to mean “earlier in time or order.” For example,
### supporters of states' rights point out that the individual states
### enjoyed certain rights anterior to their joining the union. And
### prenuptial agreements are designed to protect the assets that one or
### both parties acquired anterior to the marriage.

### ORTHO
### comes from orthos, the Greek word for “straight,” “right,” or
### “true.” Orthotics is a branch of therapy that straightens out your
### stance or posture by providing artificial support for weak joints or
### muscles. And orthograde animals, such as human beings, walk with
### their bodies in a “straight” or vertical position.

### orthodontics
### A branch of dentistry that deals
### with the treatment and correction of crooked teeth and other
### irregularities.
### • A specialty in orthodontics would require three more years of study
### after completing her dentistry degree.
### Orthodontics has been practiced since ancient times, but the
### elaborate techniques familiar to us today were introduced only in
### recent decades. Braces, retainers, and headgear are used to fix such
### conditions as crowding of the teeth and overbites. According to a
### 1939 text, “Speech defects, psychiatric disturbances, personality
### changes, . . . all are correctable through orthodontic measures,”
### though many adolescents, having endured the embarrassment of
### rubber bands breaking and even of entangling their braces while
### kissing, might disagree.

### orthodox
### (1) Holding established beliefs, especially
### in religion. (2) Conforming to established rules or traditions;
### conventional.
### • The O'Briens remain orthodox Catholics, faithfully observing the
### time-honored rituals of their church.
### An orthodox religious belief or interpretation is one handed down by
### a church's founders or leaders. When capitalized, as in Orthodox
### Judaism, Orthodox refers to a branch within a larger religious
### organization that claims to honor the religion's original or traditional
### beliefs. The steadfast holding of established beliefs that is seen in
### religious orthodoxy is apparent also in other kinds of orthodox
### behavior. Orthodox medical treatment, for example, follows the
### established practices of mainstream medicine. Unorthodox thinking
### is known in business language as “thinking outside the box.”

### orthopedics
### The correction or prevention of
### deformities of the skeleton.
### • For surgery to correct the child's spinal curvature, they were
### referred to the hospital's orthopedics section.
### Just as an orthodontist corrects crookedness in the teeth, an
### orthopedist corrects crookedness in the skeleton. Orthopedics is
### formed in part from the Greek word for “child,” and many orthopedic
### patients are in fact children. But adults also often have need of
### orthopedic therapy, as when suffering from a joint disease like
### arthritis or when recovering from a broken arm or leg.

### orthography
### The spelling of words, especially
### spelling according to standard usage.
### • Even such eloquent writers as George Washington and Thomas
### Jefferson were deficient in the skill of orthography.
### Even as recently as the 19th century, the orthography of the English
### language was still unsettled. Not until spelling books like Noah
### Webster's and textbooks like “McGuffey's Readers” came along did
### uniform spelling become established in the U.S. Before that, there
### was much orthographic variation, even among the more educated.
### The many people who still have problems with spelling can take
### heart from Mark Twain, who once remarked, “I don't give a damn for
### a man that can spell a word only one way.”

### RECT
### comes from the Latin word rectus, which means “straight” or
### “right.” To correct something is to make it right. A rectangle is a
### four-sided figure with straight parallel sides. Rectus, short for Latin
### rectus musculus, may refer to any of several straight muscles, such
### as those of the abdomen.

### rectitude
### Moral integrity.
### • The school superintendent was stern and not terribly popular, but
### no one questioned her moral rectitude.
### We associate straightness with honesty, so if we suspect someone is
### lying we might ask if they're being “straight” with us, and we might
### call a lawbreaker crooked or label him a crook. Rectitude may sound
### a little old-fashioned today, but the virtue it represents never really
### goes out of style.

### rectify
### To set right; remedy.
### • The college is moving to rectify this unfortunate situation before
### anyone else gets hurt.
### We rectify something by straightening it out or making it right. We
### might rectify an injustice by seeing to it that a wrongly accused
### person is cleared. An error in a financial record can be rectified by
### replacing an incorrect number with a correct one. If the error is in
### our tax return, the Internal Revenue Service will be happy to rectify
### it for us; we might then have to rectify the impression that we were
### trying to cheat on our taxes.

### rectilinear
### (1) Moving in or forming a straight
### line. (2) Having many straight lines.
### • After admiring Frank Lloyd Wright's rectilinear buildings for years,
### the public was astonished by the giant spiral of the Guggenheim
### Museum.
### Rectilinear patterns or constructions are those in which straight lines
### are strikingly obvious. In geometry, rectilinear usually means
### “perpendicular”; thus, a rectilinear polygon is a many-sided shape
### whose angles are all right angles (the footprints of most houses,
### with their extensions and garages, are good examples). But
### rectilinear is particularly used in physics. Rectilinear motion is motion
### in which the speed remains constant and the path is a straight line;
### and rectilinear rays, such as light rays, travel in a straight line.

### directive
### Something that guides or directs; especially,
### a general instruction from a high-level body or official.
### • At the very beginning of the administration, the cabinet secretary
### had sent out a directive to all border-patrol personnel.
### As the definition states, a directive directs. A directive from a school
### principal might provide guidance about handling holiday celebrations
### in class. A directive from the Vatican might specify new wording for
### the Mass in various languages. Even the European Union issues
### directives to its member countries, which they often ignore.

### EU
### comes from the Greek word for “well”; in English words it can
### also mean “good” or “true.” A veterinarian who performs euthanasia
### is providing a very sick or hopelessly injured animal a “good” or easy
### death.

### eugenic
### Relating to or fitted for the production of good
### offspring through controlled breeding.
### • Eugenic techniques have been part of sheep breeding for many
### years.
### The word eugenic, like the name Eugene, includes the Greek root
### meaning “born” (see
### GEN
### ). Breeders of farm animals have long used
### eugenic methods to produce horses that run faster, for example, or
### pigs that provide more meat. Through eugenics, Holstein cows have
### become one of the world's highest producers of milk. But eugenics
### also has a dark side. The idea of human eugenics was taken up
### enthusiastically by the Nazis in the 20th century, with terrible
### consequences.

### euphemism
### An agreeable or inoffensive word or
### expression that is substituted for one that may offend or disgust.
### • The Victorians, uncomfortable with the physical side of human
### existence, had euphemisms for most bodily functions.
### The use of euphemisms is an ancient part of the English language,
### and perhaps of all languages, and all of us use them. Golly and gosh
### started out as euphemisms for God, and darn is a familiar
### euphemism for damn. Shoot, shucks, and sugar are all euphemistic
### substitutes for a well-known vulgar word. Pass away for die,
### misspeak for lie, downsize for fire, senior citizen for old person—the
### list goes on and on.

### euphoria
### A strong feeling of well-being or happiness.
### • Swept up in the euphoria of a Super Bowl victory, the whole city
### seemed to have poured out into the streets.
### Euphoria is the feeling of an intense (and usually temporary) “high.”
### Doctors use the word for the kind of abnormal or inappropriate high
### spirits that might be caused by a drug or by mental illness, but
### euphoria is usually natural and appropriate. When we win enough
### money in the lottery to buy several small Pacific islands, or even just
### when the home team wins the championship, we have good reason
### to feel euphoric.

### eulogy
### (1) A formal speech or writing especially in honor
### of a dead person. (2) High praise.
### • The book was a fond eulogy to the 1950s, when Americans had
### joined social organizations of all kinds.
### With its -logy ending (see
### LOG
### ), eulogy means literally something
### like “good speech.” We are told to speak only good of the dead, but
### a eulogist actually makes a speech in the dead person's honor—or
### often instead for someone living, who might actually be there in the
### audience. The most famous eulogies include Lincoln's Gettysburg
### Address and Pericles' funeral oration for the Athenian warriors; but
### these are only two of the many great eulogies, which continue to be
### delivered not only at funerals and memorial services but at
### retirement parties, anniversary parties, and birthday parties.

### DYS
### comes from Greek, where it means “bad” or “difficult.” So
### dysphagia is difficult swallowing, and dyspnea is difficult or labored
### breathing. Dysphasia is an inability to use and understand language
### because of injury to or disease of the brain. Dys- is sometimes close
### in meaning to dis- (see
### DIS
### ), but try not to confuse the two.

### dystopia
### An imaginary place where people lead
### dehumanized and often fearful lives.
### • For a 10-year-old British boy, boarding school could be a grim
### dystopia, with no comforts, harsh punishments, and constant
### bullying.
### Dystopia was created from Utopia, the name of an ideal country
### imagined by Sir Thomas More in 1516. For More, the suffix -topia
### meant “place” (see
### TOP
### ), and u- (from the Greek root ou) meant
### “no,” but also perhaps “good” (see
### EU
### ). In other words, More's
### Utopia was too good to be true. It's probably no accident that
### dystopia was first used around 1950, soon after George Orwell
### published his famous novel Nineteen Eighty-Four and 16 years after
### Aldous Huxley published Brave New World. These two are still the
### most famous of the 20th century's many depressingly dystopian
### novels. And what about all those bleak futuristic films: Blade Runner,
### Brazil, The Matrix, and the rest? What does it mean when no one
### will paint a picture of a happy future?

### dyslexia
### A disturbance or interference with the
### ability to read or to use language.
### • She managed to deal with her dyslexia through careful tutoring all
### throughout elementary school.
### Dyslexia is a neurological disorder that usually affects people of
### average or superior intelligence. Dyslexic individuals have an
### impaired ability to recognize and process words and letters. Dyslexia
### usually shows itself in the tendency to read and write words and
### letters in reversed order; sometimes similar reversals occur in the
### person's speech. Dyslexia has been shown to be treatable through
### patient instruction in proper reading techniques.

### dyspeptic
### (1) Relating to or suffering from
### indigestion. (2) Having an irritable temperament; ill-humored.
### • For decades the dyspeptic columnist served as the newspaper's—
### and the city's—resident grouch.
### Dyspepsia comes from the Greek word for “bad digestion.”
### Interestingly, the Greek verb pessein can mean either “to cook” or
### “to digest”; bad cooking has been responsible for a lot of dyspepsia.
### Dyspepsia can be caused by many diseases, but dyspeptic
### individuals are often the victims of their own habits and appetites.
### Worry, overeating, inadequate chewing, and excessive smoking and
### drinking can all bring on dyspepsia. Today we generally use
### dyspeptic to mean “irritable”—that is, in the kind of mood that could
### be produced by bad digestion.

### dysplasia
### Abnormal development of cells or organs,
### or an abnormal structure resulting from such growth.
### • The infant was born with minor hip dysplasia, which was fixed by a
### routine operation.
### Of the dozens of medical terms that begin with the dys- prefix,
### dysplasia (with the suffix -plasia, meaning “development”) is one of
### the more common, though not many nondoctors know it. Structural
### dysplasias are usually something you're born with; they often involve
### the hip or the kidneys. But cell dysplasia is often associated with
### cancer. And a dysplastic mole—a mole that changes shape in an odd
### way—is always something to be concerned about.

## Latin Borrowings
### a fortiori
### All the more certainly.
### • If drug users are going to be subject to mandatory sentences,
### then, a fortiori, drug dealers should be subject to them also.
### A fortiori in Latin literally means “from the stronger (argument).” The
### term is used when drawing a conclusion that's even more obvious or
### convincing than the one just drawn. Thus, if teaching English
### grammar to native speakers is difficult, then, a fortiori, teaching
### English grammar to nonnative speakers will be even more
### challenging.

### a posteriori
### Relating to or derived by reasoning
### from known or observed facts.
### • Most Presidents will come to the a posteriori conclusion that a
### booming economy is entirely due to their own economic policies.
### A posteriori, Latin for “from the latter,” is a term from logic, which
### usually refers to reasoning that works backward from an effect to its
### causes. This kind of reasoning can sometimes lead to false
### conclusions. The fact that sunrise follows the crowing of a rooster,
### for example, doesn't necessarily mean that the rooster's crowing
### caused the sun to rise.

### a priori
### Relating to or derived by reasoning from self-
### evident propositions.
### • Her colleagues rejected the a priori argument because it rested on
### assumptions they felt weren't necessarily true.
### A priori, Latin for “from the former,” is traditionally contrasted with a
### posteriori (see above). The term usually describes lines of reasoning
### or arguments that proceed from the general to the particular, or
### from causes to effects. Whereas a posteriori knowledge is
### knowledge based solely on experience or personal observation, a
### priori knowledge is knowledge that comes from the power of
### reasoning based on self-evident truths. So, for example, “Every
### mother has had a child” is an a priori statement, since it shows
### simple logical reasoning and isn't a statement of fact about a specific
### case (such as “This woman is the mother of five children”) that the
### speaker knew about from experience.

### bona fide
### (1) Made in good faith, without deceit. (2)
### Authentic or genuine.
### • According to the broker, they've made a bona fide offer to buy the
### property.
### Bona fide means “in good faith” in Latin. When applied to business
### deals and the like, it stresses the absence of fraud or deception. A
### bona fide sale of securities is an entirely aboveboard transaction.
### Outside of business and law, bona fide implies mere sincerity and
### earnestness. A bona fide promise is one that the person has every
### intention of keeping. A bona fide proposal of marriage is one made
### by a suitor who isn't kidding around. Bona fide also has the noun
### form bona fides; when someone asks about someone else's bona
### fides, it usually means evidence of their qualifications or
### achievements.

### carpe diem
### Enjoy the pleasures or opportunities
### of the moment without concern about the future.
### • When he learned the phrase “Carpe diem” in high-school Latin
### class, he knew he'd found the motto he would live by for the rest of
### his life.
### Carpe diem, a phrase that comes from the Roman poet Horace,
### means literally “Pluck the day,” though it's usually translated as
### “Seize the day.” A free translation might be “Enjoy yourself while you
### have the chance.” For some people, Carpe diem serves as the closest
### thing to a philosophy of life as they'll ever have.

### caveat emptor
### Let the buyer beware.
### • The best rule to keep in mind when buying anything from a
### pushcart is: “Caveat emptor.”
### “Without a warranty, the buyer must take the risk” is the basic
### meaning of the phrase caveat emptor. In the days when buying and
### selling was carried on in the local marketplace, the rule was a
### practical one. Buyer and seller knew each other and were on equal
### footing. The nature of modern commerce and technology placed the
### buyer at a disadvantage, however, so a stack of regulations have
### been written by federal, state, and local agencies to protect the
### consumer against dangerous or defective products, fraudulent
### practices, and the like. But the principle that a buyer needs a
### warranty if he is to avoid risk remains an important legal concept.
### Note that a caveat is a small warning or explanation intended to
### avoid misinterpretation.

### corpus delicti
### (1) The substantial and basic fact
### or facts necessary to prove that a crime has been committed. (2)
### The material substance, such as the murdered body, on which a
### crime has been committed.
### • The police believed they had solved the crime, but couldn't prove
### their case without the corpus delicti.
### Corpus delicti literally means “body of the crime” in Latin. In its
### original sense, the body in question refers not to a corpse but to the
### body of essential facts that, taken together, prove that a crime has
### been committed. In popular usage, corpus delicti also refers to the
### actual physical object upon which a crime has been committed. In a
### case of arson, it would be a ruined building; in a murder case, the
### victim's corpse.

### curriculum vitae
### A short summary of one's
### career and qualifications, typically prepared by an applicant for a
### position; résumé.
### • The job advertisement asked for an up-to-date curriculum vitae
### and three recommendations.
### The Latin phrase curriculum vitae, often abbreviated CV, literally
### means “the course of one's life.” The term is usually used for
### applications for jobs in the sciences and medicine and for teaching
### positions in colleges and universities. A shorter term is simply vita,
### meaning “life.” In other fields, résumé is more commonly used in the
### U.S.; in England, however, curriculum vitae is the usual term for any
### job application.
