### TOP
### comes from topos, the Greek word for “place.” A topic is a
### subject rather than a place; to the Greeks, the original word meant
### more or less “about one place or subject (rather than another)”—
### which just goes to show that it's not always easy to trace a word's
### meaning from its roots.

### topical
### (1) Designed for local application to or
### treatment of a bodily part. (2) Referring to the topics of the day.
### • If the topical ointment doesn't work on the rash, the doctor will
### prescribe an antibiotic pill.
### Like a topical medicine, a topical reference or story applies to
### something specific, focusing on a topic that's currently in the news.
### TV comedians often use topical humor, making jokes about a
### currently popular movie or the latest political scandal—if possible,
### one that just broke that same day. Topical humor has a short
### lifespan, though, because the news keeps changing and the new hot
### topics just keep coming. The medical meaning of topical stays closer
### to the meaning of the root, since it describes something that's put
### right on the place that seems to need it.

### ectopic
### Occurring or originating in an abnormal place.
### • A pacemaker was installed to correct her ectopic heartbeat.
### Ectopic is a medical word that means basically “out of place.” An
### ectopic kidney is located in an abnormal position. In patients with an
### ectopic heartbeat, the electrical signals that trigger the heart
### muscles originate in an abnormal area of the heart. But ectopic most
### commonly describes a pregnancy in which the fertilized egg begins
### to develop in an area outside the uterus, such as in a fallopian tube;
### such pregnancies may lead to serious problems if not treated.

### utopian
### Relating to an imaginary place in which the
### government, laws, and social conditions are perfect.
### • Some of the new mayor's supporters had gotten increasingly
### unrealistic, and seemed to expect that she could turn the city into a
### utopian community.
### In 1516 Thomas More published Utopia, a description of a fictional
### island in the Atlantic with an ideal society, in order to draw a sharp
### contrast with the disorderly political situation of his own time. He
### created the name from topos (“place”) and ou, Greek for “no,” since
### he was well aware that nowhere so perfect was likely to exist on
### earth. People have long dreamed of creating utopian communities;
### some of them have joined communes, societies where other idealists
### like themselves have chosen to live in a cooperative way according
### to certain principles. Not just communes but plans of all kinds have
### been labeled utopian by critics. But we can dream, can't we?

### topography
### (1) The art of showing the natural and
### man-made features of a region on a map or chart. (2) The features
### of a surface, including both natural and man-made features.
### • Planning the expedition involved careful study of the region's
### topography.
### Topography combines top- with graph-, a root meaning “write” or
### “describe.” The topography of the Sahara Desert features shifting
### sand dunes and dry, rocky mountains. A topographic (or topo) map
### not only shows the surface features of a region but also indicates
### the contours and approximate altitude of every location, by means of
### numerous curving lines, each indicating a single elevation. In other
### words, it shows a “three-dimensional” picture on a two-dimensional
### surface. Topo maps are commonly used by hikers, surveyors,
### government workers, and engineers, among other people.

### CENTR/CENTER
### comes from the Greek kentron and the Latin
### centrum, meaning “sharp point” or “center point of a circle.” A
### centrifuge is a spinning machine that throws things outward from
### the center; the apparent force that pushes them outward is called
### centrifugal force.

### eccentric
### (1) Not following an established or usual
### style or conduct. (2) Straying from a circular path; off-center.
### • She keeps a dozen stray cats in her house and is rather eccentric,
### but her neighbors say she's very pleasant and completely harmless.
### An eccentric wheel spins unevenly, and an eccentric person is
### similarly a little off-center. Most eccentricities are inoffensive to
### others, and some may even do some good. For instance, riding a
### bicycle to work might be considered eccentric by some people, but
### it's good exercise and it cuts down on pollution. Some eccentrics are
### just ahead of their time.

### epicenter
### (1) The location on the earth's surface
### directly above the focus of an earthquake. (2) The center or focus of
### activity.
### • The destruction caused by Mexico City's earthquake was extensive
### because the city was at the quake's epicenter.
### The meaning of epi- in epicenter is “over,” so the epicenter of an
### earthquake lies over the center or “focus” of the quake. Epicenter
### can also refer to the centers of things that may seem in their own
### way as powerful—though not as destructive—as earthquakes. Wall
### Street, for example, might be said to lie at the epicenter of the
### financial world.

### egocentric
### Overly concerned with oneself; self-
### centered.
### • He's brilliant but completely egocentric, and the only things he'll
### talk about are his own life and work.
### Ego means “I” in Latin. To an egocentric person, I is the most
### important word in the language. Great artists and writers are often
### egocentrics; such people can be hard to live with, though their
### egocentricity, an unfortunate side effect of their talent, is often
### forgiven. But ordinary egocentricity, which shows up as selfishness,
### lack of sympathy, and lack of interest in other people, usually has
### little to do with any personal talent or success.

### ethnocentric
### Marked by or based on the attitude
### that one's own group is superior to others.
### • Some reviewers criticized the ethnocentric bias that came through
### in the way the film portrayed immigrants.
### The Greek word ethnos means “nation” or “people.” So
### ethnocentricity shows itself in a lack of respect for other ways of life,
### and an ethnocentric person feels that his or her own nation or group
### is the cultural center of the world. Ethnocentric describes the kind of
### person who behaves badly when traveling in foreign countries, often
### called an “Ugly American” (from a book and movie of the same
### name). Whenever you hear someone making fun of the way a
### foreigner speaks English, just remember that it's the foreigner, not
### the person laughing at him, who actually can speak a foreign
### language.

### DOM
### comes from the Latin domus, “house,” and dominus, “master,”
### and the two are indeed related. In the Bible, King Ahasuerus,
### angered by his queen's disobedience, proclaims that “every man is
### to be master of his own house,” and in the Roman empire no one
### doubted that this was how it was meant to be. A domain is the area
### where a person has authority or is dominant—but we no longer think
### of a house as the domain of a single dominant member of a family.

### dominion
### (1) An area over which one rules; domain.
### (2) Supreme authority.
### • The Roman empire had dominion over the entire Mediterranean,
### which the Romans called mare nostrum, “our sea.”
### The ruler of a region has dominion over it, and the area itself may
### be called the ruler's dominion. In the days of the British Empire,
### England had dominion over many countries throughout the world.
### Though Canada has been quite independent of Great Britain since
### the 19th century, it was generally referred to as the Dominion of
### Canada in official documents until at least the 1950s. The word has
### an old-fashioned sound today, and probably shows up in history
### books, historical novels, and fantasy video games more often than in
### discussions of modern nations.

### predominant
### Greater in importance, strength,
### influence, or authority.
### • The predominant color of the desert landscape was a rusty brown.
### Something predominant stands out above all the rest. The
### predominant theme in an essay is the one that predominates—the
### main idea that the writer wants to express. (Notice the difference
### between the adjective and the verb; be sure not to spell the
### adjective with an -ate ending.) The word is widely used in many
### fields. For example, the predominant language of Switzerland is
### German; the predominant cause of obesity in children is a bad diet;
### and your predominant reason for wanting a larger vocabulary may
### be to simply be a better-educated person—though the positive
### effects of a large vocabulary on one's romantic life are well known.

### domineering
### Tending to control the behavior of
### others in a bossy manner.
### • His mother was a domineering type, and not even his stepfather
### dared do anything without her permission.
### To be domineering is to behave like a lord. (The word lordly doesn't
### express quite the same thing.) Someone who tells you what you can
### wear or what friends you can spend time with could be called
### domineering; so could someone who always decides what you're
### going to do with your free time. Those of us who grow up with a
### domineering parent usually flee as soon as we're old enough.

### domination
### (1) Supremacy or power over
### another. (2) The exercise of governing or controlling influence.
### • The region was under the domination of a single nation, even
### though it hadn't yet invaded its neighbors.
### Domination may sound like something that's achieved by military
### force. The total domination of Europe, for example, has never been
### achieved: The Roman empire could never fully dominate the
### northern Germanic tribes; Napoleon couldn't conquer Spain; and
### although Adolf Hitler was briefly dominant over most of the
### continent, he never managed to overpower England. But the word's
### earliest appearances don't necessarily involve physical force;
### Chaucer, for instance, speaks of a mind's domination by strong drink.
### So we may observe that a great tennis player has continued his
### domination of the world's courts this season, or that the domination
### of popular music by rock and roll was obvious by the end of the
### 1950s.

### OMNI
### comes from the Latin word omnis, meaning “all.” So in
### English words, omni- can mean “in all ways,” “in all places,” or
### “without limits.” An omnidirectional antenna, for example, is one that
### receives or sends radio waves equally well in all directions. And
### Omni by itself has been used repeatedly as a brand name for things
### as different as a hotel chain and a science magazine.

### omnivore
### An animal that eats both plants and other
### animals.
### • If we're all natural omnivores, she kept asking herself, then why
### wouldn't her toddler eat anything but cashews and peanut butter
### until the age of four?
### Human beings seem to be classic omnivores. Originally living as
### “hunter-gatherers,” we hunted and fished when possible but also
### gathered nuts, berries, fruits, seeds, and roots for much of our diet.
### We're physically well suited for both tasks; our hands are perfect for
### picking things, and our build is ideal for running down even the
### fastest game animals because of our great stamina. Some 10,000
### years ago humans began practicing agriculture involving both
### animals and plants. The other omnivorous mammals include
### chimpanzees, pigs, opossums, porcupines, bears, raccoons, skunks,
### chipmunks, mice and rats, and skunks. But even many mammals
### classed as carnivorous (see
### VOR
### ) turn out to be capable of shifting
### to plant foods when necessary.

### omnipotent
### Having complete or unlimited power;
### all-powerful.
### • What really scares these men is the nightmare of an omnipotent
### state, and they think that with their guns they'll be able to keep the
### government's forces at bay when the time comes.
### If you know that potens means “power” in Latin (see
### POT
### ), it's not
### hard to guess the meaning of omnipotent. In Christian services and
### prayers, the Latin omnipotens is translated as “almighty” and always
### applied to God. But omnipotence in a government or ruler is
### naturally a bit scary; as a British lord observed a century ago,
### “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” So
### democracies do their best to make omnipotence impossible.

### omnibus
### Of or including many things.
### • Eager to go home for vacation, Senate leaders assembled an
### omnibus bill to tie up the loose ends on dozens of unrelated
### projects.
### In Latin, omnibus means “for all.” So an omnibus bill in Congress
### packages several measures together, an omnibus survey may poll
### the public on a wide range of issues, and an omnibus edition of a
### writer's stories may bring together just about all of them. As a noun,
### omnibus used to mean a large vehicle for public transportation—that
### is, “for all” who could pay the fare—but around 1900 the word
### began to be shortened to simply bus.

### omniscient
### Knowing everything; having unlimited
### understanding or knowledge.
### • Brought up in a strict Christian family, he knew that an omniscient
### God was watching him every second of his life.
### Omniscience is something that a totalitarian state may try to achieve
### by means of informers, cameras, and monitoring of electronic
### communication. If your English teacher tells you that a novel has an
### “omniscient narrator,'' she means that the voice telling the story isn't
### one of the characters but instead knows what each of them is doing
### and thinking, with the point of view constantly shifting from one to
### another.

### Answers

### HOL/HOLO
### , meaning “whole,” comes from the Greek word holos,
### with the same meaning. The root can be found in catholic. When
### capitalized, Catholic refers to the worldwide Christian church based
### in Rome, which was once the “whole”—that is, the only—Christian
### church. Without the capital letter, catholic means simply “universal”
### or, when describing a person, “broad in one's interests or tastes.”

### holistic
### Relating to or concerned with wholes or with
### complete systems rather than with the analysis of, treatment of, or
### dissection into parts.
### • Environmental scientists tend to be holistic in their views, even
### when they're only studying a tiny patch of ground.
### “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts” expresses the
### essence of holism, a term coined by the great South African general
### and statesman Jan Smuts in 1926. Holism generally opposes the
### Western tendency toward analysis, the breaking down of wholes into
### parts sometimes to the point that “you can't see the forest for the
### trees.” Holism is an important concept in the sciences and social
### sciences, and especially in medicine. Holistic medicine tries to treat
### the “whole person” rather than focusing too narrowly on single
### symptoms. It emphasizes the connections between the mind and the
### body, avoids the overuse of drugs, and has borrowed such practices
### from Eastern traditions as acupuncture and yoga.

### hologram
### A three-dimensional image reproduced
### from a pattern of interference produced by a beam of radiation such
### as a laser.
### • When holograms are used for data storage, the entire bulk of the
### storage material can be used rather than just its surface.
### A hologram is a picture of a “whole” object, showing it in three
### dimensions. We've all seen cheap holographic images on credit cards
### and ID cards (where they help prevent copying). Far more
### impressive are large holograms that take the form of a ghostly 3-D
### moving figure that you can walk around to see from all angles.
### Holograms were invented in 1947 but only perfected after the
### invention of the laser in 1960. Today they're used in such
### technologies as compact-disc players and checkout scanners, and
### holograms can be created of the inside of live internal organs to
### permit doctors to examine the organs in great detail. And soon
### televisions with hologram technology may enable us to watch in “3-
### D.”

### Holocene
### Of, relating to, or being the present geologic
### epoch.
### • As the Holocene epoch began, the glaciers were swiftly retreating,
### forests were taking over the bare land, and human beings were
### moving northward again in large numbers.
### To geologists, we live today in the Holocene epoch, the period that
### began about 10,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age, when
### humans first began practicing agriculture. But what does Holocene
### have to do with “whole”? Well, in geological language, the Holocene
### epoch follows the Paleocene (“remotely recent”), the Eocene (“early
### recent”), the Oligocene (“scarcely recent”), the Miocene (“less
### recent”), the Pliocene (“more recent”), and the Pleistocene (“most
### recent”) epochs—so the Holocene is the “wholly recent” period of
### geological time.

### holocaust
### (1) (usually capitalized) The mass
### slaughter of European civilians and especially Jews by the Nazis
### during World War II. (2) A thorough destruction involving extensive
### loss of life, especially through fire.
### • Her parents had escaped the Holocaust in Poland by fleeing into
### the forest and surviving there with hundreds of others for two years.
### The Greek word holokaustos means “burnt whole.” For the early
### Jews who followed the laws given in the first books of the Bible, a
### holocaust was a sacrifice to God, the burning on an altar of a lamb,
### goat, or young bull. The word is used about 200 times in the
### traditional Greek version of the Old Testament, though it rarely
### appears in English translations. In the 1700s holocaust began to be
### used to refer to the mass destruction of life. But no mass murder in
### Western history ever approached the scale achieved by the Nazis. As
### many as 6 million Jews may have died at their hands; when the
### slaughter of non-Jews is included, the number of murdered victims
### may have amounted to over 15 million.

### RETRO
### means “back,” “backward,” or “behind” in Latin. Retro in
### English is generally a prefix, but has also become a word in its own
### right, usually used to describe old styles or fashions.

### retroactive
### Intended to apply or take effect at a
### date in the past.
### • The fact that the tax hike was retroactive annoyed the public the
### most.
### We normally think of time as constantly moving forward. Since
### retroactive seems to defy time's forward movement, retroactive
### taxes, laws, and regulations are often seen as particularly obnoxious
### and unfair. (See also
### ex post facto
### .) But nobody ever objects to
### receiving a retroactive raise at work. When we judge historical
### people and events in terms of present-day morality and attitudes,
### our retroactive judgments may indicate that we're too impressed
### with ourselves and ignorant of history.

### retrofit
### To furnish something with new or modified parts
### or equipment that was optional or unavailable at the time of
### manufacture.
### • The office building has been retrofitted with air-conditioning, but
### the result has been a mixed success.
### The concept of retrofitting became an urgent necessity during World
### War II, when weapons technology was advancing at an intense pace
### and planes and ships were becoming outdated even before their
### construction was complete, and the only solution was to retrofit the
### completed craft with the brand-new technology. Retrofitting was
### revived on a massive scale during the energy crisis of the 1970s,
### when new features were added to millions of old houses to make
### them more energy-efficient. Retrofitting is thus different from merely
### renovating, which may not involve any new technology at all.

### retrogress
### To return to an earlier and usually worse
### or more primitive state.
### • According to the tests, the sophomores had actually retrogressed
### in the course of spring term.
### As you might guess, retrogress is the opposite of progress.
### Retrogression is usually an undesirable decline from a higher or
### advanced level. So, for instance, in difficult social situations an
### adolescent can retrogress to a childish level of maturity. And under
### the extreme conditions of total war, a whole society may retrogress
### to a primitive state. The increasing number of poor or homeless
### people has been seen as evidence of modern social retrogression,
### and the rise of loud, name-calling TV and radio personalities strikes
### many people as a sign of political retrogression.

### retrospective
### A
### generally
### comprehensive
### exhibition or performance usually covering an artist's output to date.
### • A retrospective covering the photographer's entire career is forcing
### critics to revise their earlier estimates of her status as an artist.
### Retrospective is partly rooted in the Latin verb specere, “to look,” so
### a retrospective is a look back at an artist's career. The subject of a
### retrospective is usually an older living artist, or one who has recently
### died. Galleries and museums honor painters and sculptors, film
### festivals honor directors and actors, and concert organizations honor
### composers. Retrospectives can be difficult and expensive to
### assemble, so they're rarely put together except for deserving artists;
### the result is that they frequently win many new fans for the person's
### achievement.

### TEMPOR
### comes from the Latin tempus, meaning “time.” A
### temporary repair is meant to last only a short time. The tempo, or
### speed, of a country-and-western ballad is usually different from that
### of a hip-hop number. The Latin phrase Tempus fugit means “Time
### flies,” an observation that seems more true during summer vacation
### than in the dead of winter.

### temporal
### (1) Having to do with time as opposed to
### eternity; having to do with earthly life as opposed to heavenly
### existence. (2) Having to do with time as distinguished from space.
### • The quick passing of the seasons as we grow older makes us feel
### the fleeting nature of temporal existence.
### Temporal existence is often contrasted with spiritual existence, which
### many religions teach is eternal. The American system of government
### features a separation of church and state—that is, a separation of
### spiritual and temporal authority. But such separation is relatively
### recent. In past centuries, the Roman Catholic Church exerted
### temporal authority—that is, political power—throughout much of
### Europe, and the Church of England has always been officially headed
### by the temporal ruler of Great Britain. Temporal isn't always used in
### religious contexts; for example, child psychologists often measure
### “temporal processing”—that is, speed of thinking—in children with
### mental difficulties. Note that temporal may also mean “near the
### temples (of the head)”; thus, your brain's temporal lobes are
### situated at your temples. But this temporal is based on a different
### Latin root.

### contemporary
### (1) Occurring or existing
### during the same period of time. (2) Having to do with the present
### period; modern or current.
### • The two scientists were contemporary with each other, but neither
### seemed to have heard of the other's existence.
### Contemporary can be confusing because of its slightly different
### meanings. In everyday use, it generally means simply “modern” or
### “new.” But before the 20th century it instead referred only to things
### from the same era as certain other things; so, for instance, Jesus
### was contemporary with the Roman emperors Augustus and Tiberius,
### and Muhammad was contemporary with Pope Gregory the Great.
### And
### contemporary
### is
### also
### a
### noun:
### thus,
### Jane
### Austen's
### contemporaries included Coleridge and Wordsworth, and your own
### contemporaries were born around the same year that you were.

### extemporaneous
### (1)
### Composed,
### performed, spoken, or done on the spur of the moment; impromptu
### or improvised. (2) Carefully prepared but delivered without notes.
### • It was once common in middle-class homes to make
### extemporaneous speeches, recite poetry, and give little solo song
### recitals after a dinner with guests.
### The ability to speak well extemporaneously is an important talent for
### politicians, especially when participating in debates. (Though it's also
### a good idea to have a “spin doctor” who can go out afterward and
### tell everyone what the candidate really meant to say.) Some people
### claim there's a difference between extemporaneous and impromptu,
### saying that an extemporaneous speech is planned beforehand but
### not written down, while an impromptu speech is genuinely
### unprepared or off-the-cuff, but today the two words are mostly used
### as synonyms.

### temporize
### (1) To act in a way that fits the time or
### occasion; to give way to current opinion. (2) To draw out discussions
### to gain time.
### • The legislature was accused of temporizing while the budget deficit
### continued to worsen.
### The Latin word that temporize comes from meant simply “to pass
### the time”; the meaning of the English word is different but obviously
### related. People aren't usually admired for temporizing. A political
### leader faced with a difficult issue may temporize by talking vaguely
### about possible solutions without actually doing anything. The point is
### to avoid taking an action that lots of people aren't going to like, in
### hopes that the problem will somehow go away, but the effect is
### often just to make matters worse.

### CHRON
### comes from the Greek word for “time.” A chronicle records
### the events of a particular time, which is why so many newspapers
### have the name Chronicle. A chronometer is a device for measuring
### time, usually one that's more accurate (and more expensive) than an
### ordinary watch or clock.

### chronic
### (1) Lasting a long time or recurring frequently. (2)
### Always present; constantly annoying or troubling; habitual.
### • He had stopped to pick up ice-cream cones for the kids, hoping it
### would give him a temporary rest from their chronic bickering.
### Chronic coughing goes on and on; chronic lateness occurs day after
### day; chronic lameness never seems to get any better. Unfortunately,
### situations that we call chronic almost always seem to be unpleasant.
### We never hear about chronic peace, but we do hear about chronic
### warfare. And we never speak of chronic health, only of chronic
### illness.

### chronology
### (1) A sequence of events in the order
### they occurred. (2) A table, list, or account that presents events in
### order.
### • The scandal had gotten so complex that the newspaper had to
### print a chronology showing the order of the numerous events
### involved.
### History is much more than a simple chronology of events, but
### keeping events in chronological order is the first essential step in
### thinking about it. When, for example, historians try to show how
### World War I prepared the way for World War II, tracking the
### chronology of the events in the years between the two wars can
### help in explaining a complicated historical era.

### anachronism
### (1) The error of placing a person
### or thing in the wrong time period. (2) A person or thing that is out of
### its own time.
### • A Model T Ford putt-putting down the highway at 25 miles per
### hour was an anachronism by 1940.
### In Shakespeare's time, playwrights didn't worry much about
### anachronisms. When Shakespeare saw his plays performed, all the
### characters, even Romans and Greeks, would have been dressed in
### the clothes of his own period. Macbeth, which is set in the 11th
### century, contains anachronistic references to clocks and cannons,
### which the real Macbeth would have known nothing about. Today, a
### writer may spend months doing research in order to avoid
### anachronisms in the historical novel she's working on. Using the
### second meaning of the word, we could say that manual typewriters
### and slide rules are anachronisms in these days of computers and
### calculators, and a person who likes doing things the old-fashioned
### way might himself be described as an anachronism.

### synchronous
### (1) Happening or existing at exactly
### the same time; simultaneous. (2) Recurring or acting at exactly the
### same intervals.
### • The theory depends on whether the chemical appeared in
### synchronous deposits worldwide seven million years ago.
### Communications satellites are usually put into a synchronous (or
### geosynchronous) orbit, circling the earth once every 24 hours and so
### appearing to hover over a single spot on the surface. This type of
### synchronized movement is important, since you have to know where
### to aim your satellite dish. In the computer field, synchronous usually
### refers to the use of a simple timing signal that permits very rapid
### exchange of data between computers. The kind of mysterious
### coincidence sometimes called synchronicity—such as the appearance
### of two different comic-strip characters named Dennis the Menace in
### the U.S. and Britain within three days of each other in 1951—has
### fascinated people for centuries.

## Number Words
### TRI
### means “three,” whether derived from Greek or Latin. A tricycle
### has three wheels. A triangle has three sides and three angles. And a
### triumvirate is a board or government of three people.

### triad
### (1) A group of three usually related people or things.
### (2) A secret Chinese criminal organization.
### • The kids in the garage band next door seemed to know six or
### seven triads and a couple of seventh chords.
### The best-known type of triad is a type of musical chord consisting of
### three notes. A D-major triad is made up of the notes D, F-sharp, and
### A; an F-minor triad is made up of F, A-flat, and C; and so on. Major
### and minor triads form the basis of tonal music, and songs and other
### pieces usually end with a triadic harmony. In medicine, a triad is a
### set of three symptoms that go together. The Chinese criminal
### organizations called triads got their name from the triangular symbol
### that they used back when they began, centuries ago, as patriotic
### organizations. Today, with over 100,000 members, the triads operate
### in the U.S., Canada, and many other countries.

### trilogy
### A series of three creative works that are closely
### related and develop a single theme.
### • William Faulkner's famous “Snopes trilogy” consists of the novels
### The Hamlet, The Town, and The Mansion.
### Dozens of tragic trilogies were written for the Greek stage, though
### only one, Aeschylus's great Oresteia (consisting of Agamemnon, The
### Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides), has survived complete.
### Authors in later years have occasionally chosen to create trilogies to
### allow themselves to develop a highly complex story or cover a long
### span of time. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings wasn't actually intended as
### a trilogy, but since it was published in three volumes it's usually
### called one. George Lucas's three original Star Wars movies are an
### example of a film trilogy (which he followed many years later by
### another).

### triceratops
### One of a group of large dinosaurs that
### lived during the Cretaceous period and had three horns, a bony crest
### or hood, and hoofed toes.
### • The triceratops probably used its three horns for defense against
### the attacks of meat-eating dinosaurs.
### The name triceratops, meaning literally “three-horned face,” refers to
### the two horns above its eyes and the smaller third horn on its snout.
### Just as striking was the frilled hood or ruff that rose behind its head,
### though no one is quite sure what it was for. The triceratops was one
### of the last dinosaurs to evolve and also one of the last to become
### extinct. It could reach lengths of 30 feet and could stand nearly
### eight feet high. Despite its ferocious looks and three-foot-long horns,
### the triceratops was actually a vegetarian.

### trident
### A three-pronged spear, especially one carried by
### various sea gods in classical mythology.
### • The bronze statue at the middle of the great fountain depicted a
### sea god emerging from the water, wreathed in seaweed and carrying
### a large trident.
### A trident has three prongs or teeth, as the root dent, “tooth,” tells
### us. The trident has long been used to spear fish in different parts of
### the world, so there's no mystery about why the Greek sea god
### Poseidon and his Roman counterpart Neptune both carry a trident as
### their symbol. In some gladiator exhibitions in ancient Rome, one
### gladiator, called a retiarius (“net man”), would be equipped as
### though he were a fisherman, with a weighted net and a trident; with
### his net he would snare his sword-wielding opponent, and with his
### trident he would spear his helpless foe.

### trimester
### (1) A period of about three months,
### especially one of three such periods in a human pregnancy. (2) One
### of three terms into which an academic year is sometimes divided.
### • Most women experience morning sickness in the first trimester of
### pregnancy.
### Semester, which comes from the Latin words for “six” and “month,”
### has come to mean half an academic year when the year is divided
### into two segments. When an academic year is divided into three
### segments, each is called a trimester (which is usually a bit more
### accurate, since each segment often is close to three months in
### length). Some colleges operate on the “quarter” system, with the
### summer being the fourth quarter, but this just means that each
### quarter is basically a trimester. In a human pregnancy, a trimester is
### three months long, representing one-third of the nine months that a
### typical pregnancy lasts.

### trinity
### (1) (capitalized) The unity of Father, Son, and Holy
### Spirit as three persons in one God in Christian belief. (2) A group of
### three people.
### • In Christian art depicting the Trinity, the Holy Spirit is almost
### always shown as a radiant dove.
### The nature of the Trinity (or Holy Trinity) has caused centuries of
### argument and division within the Christian faith. The word doesn't
### actually appear in the Bible itself, but the New Testament does speak
### of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit together; the Father is understood
### as the protector of the Jews, the Son as the savior of mankind, and
### the Holy Spirit as the preserver of the church. Almost all the major
### Christian sects may be called trinitarian. The island of Trinidad is one
### of many places named with the Spanish translation of Trinity.

### triptych
### (1) A picture or carving made in the form of three
### panels side by side. (2) Something composed or presented in three
### sections.
### • The Renaissance produced many beautiful triptychs portraying
### religious scenes that are still used as altarpieces.
### Triptych contains the root -ptyche, the Greek word for “fold.” So a
### traditional painted or carved triptych has three hinged panels, and
### the two outer panels fold in toward the central one. Most triptychs
### were intended to be mounted over a church altar. Many great
### triptychs were produced in the Renaissance, perhaps the most
### famous being Hieronymus Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights. But
### major triptychs continued to be produced throughout the 20th
### century by such painters as Francis Bacon.

### trivial
### Of little value or importance.
### • She was so caught up in the trivial details of the trip that she
### hardly noticed the beautiful scenery.
### Trivial comes from a Latin word meaning “crossroads”—that is,
### where three roads come together. Since a crossroads is a very public
### place where all kinds of people might show up, trivialis came to
### mean “commonplace” or “vulgar.” Today the English word has
### changed slightly in meaning and instead usually describes something
### barely worth mentioning. Mathematicians use the word to refer to
### some part of a proof or definition that's extremely simple and
### needn't be explained, but the rest of us tend to use it just to mean
### “unimportant.” “Small talk” at a party, for example, is usually trivial
### conversation, though a trivial excuse for not going on a date (“I
### have to wash my hair”) might hide an emotion that isn't so trivial (“I
### can't stand the sight of you”). To trivialize something is to treat it as
### if it didn't matter, as if it were just another triviality.
