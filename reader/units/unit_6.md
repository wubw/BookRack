### EQU
### comes from the Latin word aequus, meaning “equal.” To
### equalize means to make things equal. Things that are equivalent
### have the same value, use, or meaning. All three sides of an
### equilateral triangle are of the same length. And an equation (for
### instance, 21 + 47 = 68) is a statement that two mathematical
### expressions are equal.

### equable
### (1) Tending to remain calm. (2) Free from
### harsh changes or extreme variation.
### • Her friends thought it odd that such an equable woman had
### married a man so moody and unpredictable.
### Equable usually describes either climate or personality. The word
### seems to be used less today than in decades past, maybe because
### the personality type is less admired than it used to be. A steady,
### calm, equable personality may not produce much excitement but
### usually makes for a good worker and a good parent, and maybe
### even a longer life. In the words of the poet Robert Service: “Avoid
### extremes: be moderate / In saving and in spending. / An equable
### and easy gait / Will win an easy ending.”

### adequacy
### Being equal to some need or requirement.
### • Environmentalists doubt the adequacy of these regulations to
### protect the wilderness areas.
### When we question the adequacy of health-care coverage, or parking
### facilities, or school funding, we're asking if they are equal to our
### need. The adjective adequate means “enough” or “acceptable”—
### though in sentences like “His performance was adequate,” it really
### means “no better than acceptable.”

### equilibrium
### (1) A state in which opposing
### forces are balanced so that one is not stronger or greater than the
### other. (2) A state of emotional balance or calmness.
### • The news had come as a shock, and it took him several minutes to
### recover his equilibrium.
### Equilibrium contains a root from the Latin libra, meaning “weight” or
### “balance.” As a constellation, zodiac symbol, and astrological sign,
### Libra is usually pictured as a set of balance scales, often held by the
### blindfolded goddess of justice, which symbolizes fairness, equality,
### and justice. Equilibrium has special meanings in biology, chemistry,
### physics, and economics, but in all of them it refers to the balance of
### competing influences.

### equinox
### A day when day and night are the same
### length.
### • She and her friends got together for an equinox party twice a year
### to celebrate the arrival of the fall and the spring.
### If you know that nox means “night” in Latin, it's not hard to
### remember the meaning of equinox. There are two equinoxes in the
### year: the spring equinox, around March 21, and the fall equinox,
### around September 23. The equinoxes are contrasted with the
### solstices, when the sun is farthest north and south of the equator.
### The summer solstice occurs around June 22 (the longest day of the
### year), the winter solstice around December 22 (the shortest day).

### QUIS
### is derived from the Latin verb meaning “to seek or obtain.”
### The roots quer, quir, and ques are derived from the same Latin verb
### and give us words such as inquiry and question.

### inquisition
### A questioning or examining that is
### often harsh or severe.
### • The President's first choice for the job turned him down, fearing
### the Senate hearings would turn into an inquisition into her past.
### While an inquiry can be almost any search for truth, the related
### word inquisition suggests a long, thorough investigation that involves
### extensive and harsh questioning. Though the two words originally
### had about the same meaning, today inquisition tends to remind us
### of the Spanish Inquisition, an ongoing trial conducted by church-
### appointed inquisitors that began in the Middle Ages and sought out
### nonbelievers, Jews, and Muslims, thousands of whom were
### sentenced to torture and to burning at the stake.

### perquisite
### (1) A privilege or profit that is provided in
### addition to one's base salary. (2) Something claimed as an exclusive
### possession or right.
### • A new car, a big house, and yearly trips to Europe were among the
### perquisites that made the presidency of Wyndam College such an
### attractive position.
### Though the Latin source of perquisite originally meant “something
### insistently asked for,” the “ask” meaning has mostly vanished from
### the English word. A perquisite, often called simply a perk, is instead
### something of value that the holder of a particular job or position is
### entitled to, usually without even asking. The President of the United
### States, for instance, enjoys as perquisites the use of Camp David
### and Air Force One. Perhaps because perquisites are usually available
### to only a small number of people, the word sometimes refers to non-
### job-related privileges that are claimed as exclusive rights.

### acquisitive
### Eager to acquire; greedy.
### • With each year the couple became more madly acquisitive, buying
### jewelry, a huge yacht, and two country estates.
### Unlike most tribal peoples and the populations of some older
### countries, we Americans live in an acquisitive society, a society
### devoted to getting and spending. And America often makes
### successfully acquisitive people into heroes; even Ebenezer Scrooge,
### that model of miserly greed and acquisitiveness, was once defended
### by a White House chief of staff. An acquisitive nation may seek to
### acquire other territories by force. But mental acquisition of
### specialized knowledge or skills—or new vocabulary!—doesn't deprive
### others of the same information.

### requisition
### A demand or request (such as for
### supplies) made with proper authority.
### • The teachers had grown impatient with having to submit a
### requisition for even routine classroom supplies.
### Requisition was originally a noun but is now probably more common
### as a verb. So we either can speak of sending our office's purchasing
### department a requisition for computers, or of requisitioning more
### computers from the department. The word has an official sound to
### it. However, one of Hollywood's bittersweet love stories begins when
### Omar Sharif, playing a World War II freedom fighter, says to Ingrid
### Bergman, who is the owner of a stately old yellow Rolls Royce, “I've
### come to requisition your car.”

### Answers

### PLE/PLEN
### comes from a Latin word meaning “to fill.” It can be
### seen in the words plenty, meaning basically “filled,” and complete,
### meaning “thoroughly filled.”

### plenary
### (1) Including all who have a right to attend. (2)
### Complete in all ways.
### • For the convention's plenary session, five thousand members
### gathered to hear a star speaker.
### Plenary often shows up in writing referring to the “plenary power”
### held by a government, and is particularly used for powers mentioned
### in a constitution. For example, under the U.S. Constitution, the
### Congress has plenary power to wage war, which means that no one
### else—not the courts, not the states, not the president—has any
### power whatsoever to second-guess Congress about warmaking. But
### in recent years, that hasn't stopped some presidents from starting
### conflicts that looked a lot like wars to most people. At a conference,
### the plenary sessions (unlike the various smaller “presentations,”
### “workshops,” “forums,” and “seminars” that otherwise fill the day) try
### to bring everyone together in the same room.

### complement
### (1) Something that fills up or makes
### perfect; the amount needed to make something complete. (2) A
### counterpart.
### • On the committee, the two young people provided an energetic
### complement to the older members.
### A complement fills out or balances something. We think of salt as
### the complement of pepper (maybe mostly because of their colors),
### and the right necktie is a perfect complement to a good suit.
### Complement can also mean “the full quantity, number, or amount”;
### thus, a ship's complement of officers and crew is the whole force
### necessary for full operation. Complement is actually most common
### as a verb; we may say, for example, that a bright blue scarf
### complements a cream-colored outfit beautifully. Don't confuse
### complement with compliment, which means an expression of respect
### or affection.

### deplete
### To reduce in amount by using up.
### • Years of farming on the same small plot of land had left the soil
### depleted of minerals.
### The de- prefix often means “do the opposite of,” so deplete means
### the opposite of “fill.” Thus, for example, a kitchen's food supplies can
### be rapidly depleted by hungry teenagers. But deplete often suggests
### something more serious. Desertions can deplete an army; layoffs
### can deplete an office staff; and too much time in bed can rapidly
### deplete your muscular strength.

### replete
### Fully or abundantly filled or supplied.
### • The professor's autobiography was replete with scandalous
### anecdotes about campus life in the 1950s.
### Replete implies that something is filled almost to capacity. Autumn
### landscapes in New England are replete with colorful foliage.
### Supermarket tabloids are always replete with details of stars' lives,
### whether real or imaginary. And a professor may complain that most
### of the papers she received were replete with errors in grammar and
### punctuation.

### METR/METER
### comes to us from Greek by way of Latin; in both
### languages it refers to “measure.” A thermometer measures heat; a
### perimeter is the measure around something; and things that are
### isometric are equal in measure.

### metric
### (1) Relating to or based on the metric system. (2)
### Relating to or arranged in meter.
### • Americans have resisted using the metric system for years, but are
### now slowly getting accustomed to a few of the metric units.
### The metric system was invented in France in the years following the
### French Revolution, and a version of it is now used in most of the
### world to measure distance, weight, and volume. Basic metric units
### include the kilogram (the basic unit of weight), the liter (the basic
### unit of volume), and of course the meter (the basic unit of length—
### see below). Metric—or more often metrical—can also refer to the
### basic underlying rhythm of songs and poetry. So while the scientists'
### measurements are usually metric, the poets' are usually metrical.

### meter
### (1) The basic metric unit of length, equal to about
### 39.37 inches. (2) A systematic rhythm in poetry or music.
### • The basic meter of the piece was 3/4, but its rhythms were so
### complicated that the 3/4 was sometimes hard to hear.
### Meter is a metric measurement slightly longer than a yard; thus, a
### 100-meter dash might take you a second longer than a 100-yard
### dash. But the word has a different sense in music, where people
### aren't separated by whether they use the metric system. For a
### musician, the meter is the regular background rhythm, expressed by
### the “time signature” written at the beginning of a piece or section:
### 2/2, 2/4, 3/8, 4/4, 6/8, etc. Within a meter, you can create rhythms
### that range from the simple to the complex. So, for example,
### “America the Beautiful” is in 4/4 meter (or “4/4 time”), but so are
### most of the rhythmically complex songs written by Paul Simon, Burt
### Bacharach, or Stevie Wonder. In ordinary conversation, though, most
### people use “rhythm” to include meter and everything that's built on
### top of it. In poetry, meter has much the same meaning; however,
### poetic meters aren't named with numbers but instead with
### traditional Greek and Latin terms such as iambic and dactylic.

### odometer
### An instrument used to measure distance
### traveled.
### • Jennifer watched the odometer to see how far she would have to
### drive to her new job.
### Odometer includes the root from the Greek word hodos, meaning
### “road” or “trip.” An odometer shares space on your dashboard with a
### speedometer, a tachometer, and maybe a “tripmeter.” The odometer
### is what crooked car salesmen tamper with when they want to reduce
### the mileage a car registers as having traveled. One of life's little
### pleasures is watching the odometer as all the numbers change at
### the same time.

### tachometer
### A device used to measure speed of
### rotation.
### • Even though one purpose of a tachometer is to help drivers keep
### their engine speeds down, some of us occasionally try to see how
### high we can make the needle go.
### A tachometer is literally a “speed-measurer,” since the Greek root
### tach- means “speed.” This is clear in the names of the tachyon, a
### particle of matter that travels faster than the speed of light (if it
### actually exists, it's so fast that it's impossible to see with any
### instrument), and tachycardia, a medical condition in which the heart
### races uncontrollably. Since the speed that an auto tachometer
### measures is speed of rotation of the crankshaft, the numbers it
### reports are revolutions per minute, or rpm's.

### AUD
### , from the Latin verb audire, is the root that has to do with
### hearing. What is audible can be heard. An audience is a group of
### listeners, sometimes seated in an auditorium. And audio today can
### mean almost anything that has to do with sound.

### auditor
### A person who formally examines and verifies
### financial accounts.
### • It seems impossible that so many banks could have gotten into so
### much trouble if their auditors had been doing their jobs.
### The auditing of a company's financial records by independent
### examiners on a regular basis is necessary to prevent “cooking the
### books,” and thus to keep the company honest. We don't normally
### think of auditors as listening, since looking at and adding up
### numbers is their basic line of work, but auditors do have to listen to
### people's explanations, and perhaps that's the historical link. Hearing
### is more obviously part of another meaning of audit, the kind that
### college students do when they sit in on a class without taking exams
### or receiving an official grade.

### auditory
### (1) Perceived or experienced through
### hearing. (2) Of or relating to the sense or organs of hearing.
### • With the “surround-sound” systems in most theaters, going to a
### movie is now an auditory experience as much as a visual one.
### Auditory is close in meaning to acoustic and acoustical, but auditory
### usually refers more to hearing than to sound. For instance, many
### dogs have great auditory (not acoustic) powers, and the auditory
### nerve lets us hear by connecting the inner ear to the brain. Acoustic
### and acoustical instead refer especially to instruments and the
### conditions under which sound can be heard; so architects concern
### themselves with the acoustic properties of an auditorium, and
### instrument makers with those of a clarinet or piano.

### audition
### A trial performance to evaluate a performer's
### skills.
### • Auditions for Broadway shows attract so many hopeful unknown
### performers that everyone in the business calls them “cattle calls.”
### Most stars are discovered at auditions, where a number of
### candidates read the same part and the director chooses. Lana Turner
### famously skipped the audition process and was instead discovered
### by an agent sipping a soda in a Sunset Boulevard café at age 16.
### Audition can also be a verb; so, for example, after Miss Turner
### gained her stardom, actors had to audition to be her leading man.
### But when musicians audition for a job in an orchestra, it's usually
### behind a screen so that the judges won't even know their sex and
### therefore can't do anything but listen.

### inaudible
### Not heard or capable of being heard.
### • The coach spoke to her in a low voice that was inaudible to the
### rest of the gymnastics team.
### With its negative prefix in-, inaudible means the opposite of audible.
### What's clearly audible to you may be inaudible to your elderly
### grandfather. Modern spy technology can turn inaudible conversations
### into audible ones with the use of high-powered directional
### microphones, so if you think you're being spied on, make sure
### there's a lot of other noise around you. And if you don't want
### everyone around you to know you're bored, keep your sighs
### inaudible.

### SON
### is the Latin root meaning “sound.” Sonata, meaning a piece for
### one or two instruments, was originally an Italian verb meaning
### “sounded” (when singers were involved, the Italians used a different
### verb). And sonorous means full, loud, or rich in sound.

### sonic
### (1) Having to do with sound. (2) Having to do with
### the speed of sound in air (about 750 miles per hour).
### • A sonic depth finder can easily determine the depth of a lake by
### bouncing a sound signal off the bottom.
### A sonic boom is an explosive sound created by a shock wave formed
### at the nose of an aircraft. In 1947 a plane piloted by Chuck Yeager
### burst the “sound barrier” and created the first sonic boom. In the
### decades afterward sonic booms became a familiar sound to
### Americans. (Because of steps that were eventually taken, sonic
### booms are rarely heard anymore.) Today sonic is often used by
### ambitious rock musicians to describe their experimental sounds.

### dissonant
### (1) Clashing or discordant, especially in
### music. (2) Incompatible or disagreeing.
### • Critics of the health-care plan pointed to its two seemingly
### dissonant goals: cost containment, which would try to control
### spending, and universal coverage, which could increase spending.
### Since dissonant includes the negative prefix dis-, what is dissonant
### sounds or feels unresolved, unharmonic, and clashing. Early in the
### 20th century, composers such as Arnold Schoenberg and his
### students developed the use of dissonance in music as a style in
### itself. But to many listeners, the sounds in such music are still
### unbearable, and most continue to prefer music based on traditional
### tonality. Dissonant is now often used without referring to sound at
### all. Cognitive dissonance, for example, is what happens when you
### believe two different things that can't actually both be true.

### resonance
### (1) A continuing or echoing of sound. (2)
### A richness and variety in the depth and quality of sound.
### • The resonance of James Earl Jones's vocal tones in such roles as
### Darth Vader made his voice one of the most recognizable of its time.
### Many of the finest musical instruments possess a high degree of
### resonance which, by producing additional vibrations and echoes of
### the original sound, enriches and amplifies it. Violins made by the
### Italian masters Stradivari and Guarneri possess a quality of
### resonance that later violinmakers have never precisely duplicated.
### And you may have noticed how a particular note will start something
### in a room buzzing, as one of the touching surfaces begins to
### resonate with the note. Because of that, resonance and resonate—
### along with the adjective resonant—aren't always used to describe
### sound. For example, you may say that a novel resonates strongly
### with you because the author seems to be describing your own
### experiences and feelings.

### ultrasonic
### Having a frequency higher than what can
### be heard by the human ear.
### • My grandfather's dog is always pricking up its ears at some
### ultrasonic signal, while he himself is so deaf he can't even hear a
### bird singing.
### Ultrasound, or ultrasonography, works on the principle that sound is
### reflected at different speeds by tissues or substances of different
### densities. Ultrasound technology has been used medically since the
### 1940s. Sonograms, the pictures produced by ultrasound, can reveal
### heart defects, tumors, and gallstones; since low-power ultrasonic
### waves don't present any risks to a body, they're most often used to
### display fetuses during pregnancy in order to make sure they're
### healthy. Ultrasonics has many other uses, including underwater
### sonar sensing. High-power ultrasonics are so intense that they're
### actually used for drilling and welding.

### Answers

### ERR
### , from the Latin verb errare, means “to wander” or “to stray.”
### The root is seen in the word error, meaning a wandering or straying
### from what is correct or true. Erratum (plural, errata) is Latin for
### “mistake”; so an errata page is a book page that lists mistakes found
### too late to correct before the book's publication.

### errant
### (1) Wandering or moving about aimlessly. (2)
### Straying outside proper bounds, or away from an accepted pattern
### or standard.
### • Modern-day cowboys have been known to use helicopters to spot
### errant calves.
### Errant means both “wandering” and “mistaken.” A knight-errant was
### a wandering knight who went about slaying dragons or rescuing
### damsels in distress (at least when he was on good behavior). Arrant
### is a old-fashioned spelling of errant; an arrant knave (the phrase
### comes from Shakespeare) is an extremely untrustworthy individual.
### An errant sock might be one that's gotten lost; an errant politician
### might be one who's been caught cheating; and an errant cloud
### might be one that floats by all alone in a deep-blue sky on a summer
### day.

### aberrant
### Straying or differing from the right, normal, or
### natural type.
### • Sullivan's increasingly aberrant behavior was leading his friends to
### question his mental stability.
### Something aberrant has wandered away from the usual path or
### form. The word is generally used in a negative way; aberrant
### behavior, for example, may be a symptom of other problems. But
### the discovery of an aberrant variety of a species can be exciting
### news to a biologist, and identifying an aberrant gene has led the
### way to new treatments for diseases.

### erratic
### (1) Having no fixed course. (2) Lacking in
### consistency.
### • In the 1993 World Series, the Phillies weren't helped by the erratic
### performance of their ace relief pitcher, “Wild Thing.”
### Erratic can refer to literal “wandering.” A missile that loses its
### guidance system may follow an erratic path, and a river with lots of
### twists and bends is said to have an erratic course. Erratic can also
### mean “inconsistent” or “irregular.” So a stock market that often
### changes direction is said to be acting erratically; an erratic heartbeat
### can be cause for concern; and if your car idles erratically it may
### mean that something's wrong with the spark-plug wiring.

### erroneous
### Mistaken, incorrect.
### • For years her parents had had an erroneous idea of her
### intelligence, because she didn't begin to talk until the age of six.
### Erroneous basically means “containing errors,” and, since most of us
### are constantly suffering from mistaken notions, the word is often
### used in front of words such as “assumption” and “idea.” It's also
### used to describe the kind of mistaken information that can lead to
### erroneous theories, erroneous conclusions, and erroneous decisions.

### CED
### comes from the Latin verb cedere, meaning “to proceed” or “to
### yield.” Proceed itself employs the root, as does recede, and their
### related nouns procession and recession employ another form of the
### Latin verb.

### cede
### To give up, especially by treaty; yield.
### • Their 88-year-old father reluctantly ceded control over his finances
### to two of the children this year.
### Cede is often a formal term used in discussing territory and rights,
### but is also used less formally. So, for example, Spain ceded Puerto
### Rico to the U.S. in 1898, following the Spanish-American War, and
### the U.S. ceded control of the Panama Canal to Panama in 1999.
### Critics warn that we are ceding leadership in alternative-energy
### technology to China. Citizens of one European country or another
### are always worrying that their own country is ceding too much
### power to the European Union. A tennis player doesn't have any
### choice when she cedes her no. 1 ranking to a rival.

### concede
### To admit grudgingly; yield.
### • To his friends, Senator Beasley concedes that his reelection
### campaign was badly run and that he made several damaging errors.
### After the votes have been counted, one candidate traditionally
### concedes the election to his or her opponent by giving a concession
### speech. If you're lucky, your boss will concede that she was wrong
### the last time she criticized you. But in the middle of an argument,
### we're not all so good at conceding that the other guy might have a
### good point.

### accede
### (1) To give in to a request or demand. (2) To give
### approval or consent.
### • This time Congress refused to accede to the demands of the
### president, and began cutting the funding for the war.
### To accede usually means to yield, often under pressure and with
### some reluctance, to the needs or requests of others. Voters usually
### accede to a tax increase only when they're convinced it's the only
### real solution to a shortfall in government funding. A patient may
### accede to surgery only after the doctor assures him it's better than
### the alternatives. If you accede to your spouse's plea to watch the
### new reality show at 9:00, you may get to choose something better
### at 10:00.

### precedent
### Something done or said that may be an
### example or rule to guide later acts of a similar kind.
### • When Judy bought Christmas presents for all her relatives one
### year, she claimed that it set no precedent, but it did.
### A precedent is something that precedes, or comes before. The
### Supreme Court relies on precedents—that is, earlier laws or
### decisions that provide some example or rule to guide them in the
### case they're actually deciding. When hostages are being held for
### ransom, a government may worry about setting a bad precedent if it
### gives in. And a company might “break with precedent” by naming a
### foreigner as its president for the first time.

## Words from Mythology and History
### Augean stable
### A condition or place marked by
### great accumulation of filth or corruption.
### • Leaders of many of the newly formed nations of Eastern Europe
### found that the old governments of their countries had become
### Augean stables that they must now clean out.
### Augeus, the mythical king of Elis, kept great stables that held 3,000
### oxen and had not been cleaned for thirty years when Hercules was
### assigned the job as one of his famous “twelve labors.” This task was
### enormous even for someone so mighty, so Hercules shifted the
### course of two rivers to make them pour through the stables. Augean
### by itself has come to mean “extremely difficult or distasteful”, and to
### “clean the Augean stable” usually means either to clear away
### corruption or to perform a large and unpleasant task that has long
### called for attention. So today we refer to “Augean tasks,” “Augean
### labor,” or even “Augean clutter.” And the British firm Augean PLC is—
### what else?—a waste-management company.

### Croesus
### A very rich person.
### • Warren Buffett's extraordinary record of acquiring and investing
### made him an American Croesus.
### Croesus, which tends to appear in the phrase “rich as Croesus,” was
### the name of a king of Lydia, an ancient kingdom in what is now
### western Turkey, who died around 546 B.C. Lydia was probably the
### first country in history to use coins, and under the wealthy and
### powerful Croesus the first coins of pure silver and gold were
### produced, which may have added to the legends surrounding his
### wealth. But it was Croesus who the Greek lawgiver Solon was
### thinking about when he said “Count no man happy until his death”—
### and indeed Croesus was finally overthrown and may even have been
### burned alive.

### dragon's teeth
### Seeds of conflict.
### • Many experts believed that, in invading a Middle Eastern country
### that hadn't attacked us, we were sowing dragon's teeth.
### The Phoenician prince Cadmus once killed a dragon, and was
### instructed by the goddess Athena to plant its teeth in the ground.
### From the many teeth, there immediately sprang up an army of fierce
### armed men. The goddess then directed him to throw a precious
### stone into their midst, and they proceeded to slaughter each other
### until only the five greatest warriors were left; these became
### Cadmus's generals, with whom he constructed the great city-state of
### Thebes. When we “sow dragon's teeth,” we're creating the
### conditions for future trouble.

### Hades
### The underground home of the dead in Greek
### mythology.
### • In a dramatic scene, he crawls up out of the ground coated in
### black petroleum as though emerging from Hades.
### In Greek mythology, Hades is both the land of the dead and the god
### who rules there. Hades the god (who the Greeks also called Pluto) is
### the brother of Zeus and Poseidon, who rule the skies and the seas.
### The realm called Hades, where he rules with his wife Persephone, is
### the region under the earth, full of mineral wealth and fertility and
### home to dead souls. Hades today is sometimes used as a polite term
### for Hell (“It's hotter than Hades in here!”).

### lethargic
### (1) Lazily sluggish. (2) Indifferent or
### apathetic.
### • Once again the long Sunday dinner had left most of the family
### feeling stuffed and lethargic.
### The philosopher Plato wrote that before a dead person could leave
### the underworld to begin a new life, he or she had to drink from the
### river Lethe, whose name means “forgetfulness” in Greek, and forget
### all aspects of one's former life and the time spent in Hades (usually
### pretty awful, according to Plato). But lethargic and its noun lethargy
### never actually refer to forgetting; instead, they describe the weak,
### ghostly state of the dead spirits—so weak that they may require a
### drink of blood before they can even speak.

### Midas touch
### The talent for making money in every
### venture.
### • Investors are always looking for an investment adviser with the
### Midas touch, but after a couple of good years each adviser's
### brilliance usually seems to vanish.
### Midas was a legendary king of Phrygia (in modern-day Turkey). In
### return for a good deed, he was granted one wish by the god
### Dionysus, and asked for the power to turn everything he touched
### into gold. When he discovered to his horror that his touch had
### turned his food and drink—and even his daughter—to gold, he
### begged Dionysus to take back the gift, and Dionysus agreed to do
### so. When “Midas touch” is used today, the moral of this tale of greed
### is usually ignored.

### Pyrrhic victory
### A victory won at excessive cost.
### • That win turned out to be a Pyrrhic victory, since our best players
### sustained injuries that would sideline them for weeks.
### In 279 B.C. Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus, a country in northwest
### Greece, defeated the Romans at the Battle of Ausculum, but lost all
### of his best officers and many men. He is said to have exclaimed after
### the battle, “One more such victory and we are lost.” Pyrrhic victories
### are more common than we tend to think. Whenever we win an
### argument but in so doing manage to offend the friend we were
### arguing with, or whenever a country invades another country but
### rouses widespread opposition in surrounding countries in the
### process, it's probably a Pyrrhic victory that has been achieved.

### stygian
### Extremely dark, dank, gloomy, and forbidding.
### • When the power went out in the building, the halls and stairwells
### were plunged in stygian darkness.
### The Greek underworld of Hades was cold and dark, rather than
### blazing like the Christian image of Hell. The river Styx, whose name
### meant “hateful” in Greek, was the chief river of the underground,
### and the souls of the dead were ferried across its poisonous waters
### into Hades by the boatman Charon. The Styx was so terrible that
### even the gods swore by its name in their most solemn oaths. The
### name Stygia, borrowed from stygian, is used for a country in fantasy
### games today; but a stygian atmosphere, a stygian tunnel, stygian
### darkness, and so on, still describe the dreary cheerlessness of the
### Greek underworld.
