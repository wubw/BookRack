### BENE
### is Latin for “well.” A benefit is a good result or effect.
### Something beneficial produces good results or effects. The Latin root
### can be heard in other languages as well: “Good!” or “Fine!” in
### Spanish is “Bueno!”; in French, it's “Bon!”; and in Italian, just say
### “Bene!”

### benediction
### A prayer that asks for God's
### blessing, especially a prayer that concludes a worship service.
### • The moment the bishop had finished his benediction, she squeezed
### quickly out of her row and darted out the cathedral's side entrance.
### In benediction, the bene root is joined by another Latin root, dictio,
### “speaking” (see
### DICT
### ), so the word's meaning becomes something
### like “well-wishing.” Perhaps the best-known benediction is the so-
### called Aaronic Benediction from the Bible, which begins, “May the
### Lord bless you and keep you.” An important section of the Catholic
### Mass was traditionally known as the Benedictus, after its first word
### (meaning “blessed”). It was St. Benedict who organized the first
### Christian monasteries; many Christians have been baptized Benedict
### in his honor, and 16 popes have taken it as their papal name.

### benefactor
### Someone who helps another person or
### group, especially by giving money.
### • An anonymous benefactor had given $15 million to establish an
### ecological institute at the university.
### A benefactor may be involved in almost any field. One may endow a
### scholarship fund; another may give money to expand a library; still
### another may leave a generous sum to a hospital in her will. The
### famous benefactions of John D. Rockefeller included the gifts that
### established the University of Chicago, the Rockefeller Foundation,
### and Rockefeller University. Many benefactors have reported that
### giving away their money turned out to be the most rewarding thing
### they ever did.

### beneficiary
### A person or organization that
### benefits or is expected to benefit from something, especially one
### that receives money or property when someone dies.
### • Living in a trailer in near-poverty, she received word in the mail
### that her father had died, naming her as the sole beneficiary of his
### life-insurance policy.
### Beneficiary is often used in connection with life insurance, but it
### shows up in many other contexts as well. A college may be the
### beneficiary of a private donation. Your uncle's will may make a
### church his sole beneficiary, in which case all his money and property
### will go to it when he dies. A “third-party beneficiary” of a contract is
### a person (often a child) who the people signing the contract (which
### is usually an insurance policy or an employee-benefit plan) want to
### benefit from it. In a more general way, a small business may be a
### beneficiary of changes to the tax code, or a restaurant may be the
### beneficiary when the one across the street closes down and its
### whole lunch crowd starts coming in.

### benevolence
### Kindness, generosity.
### • In those financially desperate years, the young couple was saved
### only by the benevolence of her elderly great-uncle.
### Part of benevolence comes from the Latin root meaning “wish.” The
### novels of Charles Dickens often include a benevolent figure who
### rescues the main characters at some point—Mr. Brownlow in Oliver
### Twist, Abel Magwitch in David Copperfield, Mr. Jarndyce in Bleak
### House, Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol. To be benevolent, it
### helps to have money, but it's not necessary; kind assistance of a
### nonfinancial sort may turn out to be lifesaving benevolence as well.

### AM
### comes from the Latin amare, “to love.” The Roman god of love
### was known by two different names, Cupid and Amor. Amiable means
### “friendly or good-natured,” and amigo is Spanish for “friend.”

### amicable
### Friendly, peaceful.
### • Their relations with their in-laws were generally amicable, despite
### some bickering during the holidays.
### Amicable often describes relations between two groups, or especially
### two nations—for example, the United States and Canada, which are
### proud of sharing the longest unguarded border in the world. So we
### often speak of an amicable meeting or an amicable settlement.
### When amicable describes more personal relations, it may indicate a
### rather formal friendliness. But it's always nice when two friends
### who've been quarreling manage to have an amicable conversation
### and to say amicable good-byes at the end.

### enamored
### Charmed or fascinated; inflamed with love.
### • Rebecca quickly became enamored of the town's rustic
### surroundings, its slow pace, and its eccentric characters.
### Computer hackers are always enamored of their new programs and
### games. Millions of readers have found themselves enamored with
### Jane Austen's novels. And Romeo and Juliet were, of course, utterly
### enamored of each other. But we also often use the word in negative
### contexts: A friend at work may complain that she's not enamored of
### the new boss, and when you start talking about how you're not
### enamored with the neighbors it may be time to move. (Note that
### both of and with are commonly used after enamored.)

### amorous
### Having or showing strong feelings of
### attraction or love.
### • It turned out that the amorous Congressman had gotten his
### girlfriend a good job and was paying for her apartment.
### A couple smooching on a park bench could be called amorous, or a
### young married couple who are always hugging and kissing. But the
### word is often used a bit sarcastically, as when a tabloid newspaper
### gets hold of some scandalous photos and calls the participants “the
### amorous pair.” In such cases, we may be encouraged to think the
### attraction is more physical than emotional.

### paramour
### A lover, often secret, not allowed by law or
### custom.
### • He had been coming to the house for two years before her
### brothers realized that he was actually the paramour of their shy and
### withdrawn sister.
### Paramour came to English from French (a language based on Latin),
### though the modern French don't use the word. Since par amour
### meant “through love,” it implies a relationship based solely on love,
### often physical love, rather than on social custom or ceremony. So
### today it tends to refer to the lover of a married man or woman, but
### may be used for any lover who isn't obeying the social rules.

### BELL
### comes from the Latin word meaning “war.” Bellona was the
### little-known Roman goddess of war; her husband, Mars, was the god
### of war.

### antebellum
### Existing before a war, especially before
### the American Civil War (1861–65).
### • When World War I was over, the French nobility found it impossible
### to return to their extravagant antebellum way of life.
### Even countries that win a war often end up worse off than they had
### been before, and the losers almost always do. So antebellum often
### summons up images of ease, elegance, and entertainment that
### disappeared in the postwar years. In the American South, the
### antebellum way of life depended on a social structure, based on
### slavery, that collapsed after the Civil War; Margaret Mitchell's Gone
### with the Wind shows the nostalgia and bitterness felt by wealthy
### Southerners after the war more than the relief and anticipation
### experienced by those released from slavery. In Europe, World War I
### shattered the grand life of the upper classes, even in victorious
### France and Britain, and changed society hugely in the space of just
### four years.

### bellicose
### Warlike, aggressive, quarrelsome.
### • The more bellicose party always got elected whenever there was
### tension along the border and the public believed that military action
### would lead to security.
### Since bellicose describes an attitude that hopes for actual war, the
### word is generally applied to nations and their leaders. In the 20th
### century, it was commonly used to describe such figures as
### Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm, Italy's Benito Mussolini, and Japan's
### General Tojo, leaders who believed their countries had everything to
### gain by starting wars. The international relations of a nation with a
### bellicose foreign policy tend to be stormy and difficult, and bellicosity
### usually makes the rest of the world very uneasy.

### belligerence
### Aggressiveness, combativeness.
### • The belligerence in Turner's voice told them that the warning was a
### serious threat.
### Unlike bellicose and bellicosity, the word belligerence can be used at
### every level from the personal to the global. The belligerence of
### Marlon Brando's performances as the violent Stanley Kowalski in A
### Streetcar Named Desire electrified the country in the 1940s and '50s.
### At the same time, belligerent speeches by leaders of the Soviet
### Union and the United States throughout the Cold War were keeping
### the world on edge. Belligerent is even a noun; the terrible war in the
### Congo in recent years, for example, has involved seven nations as
### belligerents.

### rebellion
### Open defiance and opposition, sometimes
### armed, to a person or thing in authority.
### • A student rebellion that afternoon in Room 13 resulted in the new
### substitute teacher racing out of the building in tears.
### Plenty of teenagers rebel against their parents in all kinds of ways.
### But a rebellion usually involves a group. Armed rebellions are usually
### put down by a country's armed forces, or at least kept from
### expanding beyond a small area. The American War of Independence
### was first viewed by the British as a minor rebellion that would soon
### run its course, but this particular rebellion led to a full-fledged
### revolution—that is, the overthrow of a government. Rebellion, armed
### or otherwise, has often alerted those in power that those they
### control are very unhappy.

### PAC
### is related to the Latin words for “agree” and “peace.” The
### Pacific Ocean—that is, the “Peaceful Ocean”—was named by
### Ferdinand Magellan because it seemed so calm after he had sailed
### through the storms near Cape Horn. (Magellan obviously had never
### witnessed a Pacific typhoon.)

### pacify
### (1) To soothe anger or agitation. (2) To subdue by
### armed action.
### • It took the police hours to pacify the angry demonstrators.
### Someone stirred up by a strong emotion can usually be pacified by
### some kind words and the removal of its causes. Unhappy babies are
### often given a rubber pacifier for sucking to make them stop crying.
### During the Vietnam War, pacification of an area meant using armed
### force to drive out the enemy, which might be followed by bringing
### the local people over to our side by building schools and providing
### social services. But an army can often bring “peace” by pure force,
### without soothing anyone's emotions.

### pacifist
### A person opposed to war or violence, especially
### someone who refuses to bear arms or to fight, on moral or religious
### grounds.
### • Her grandfather had fought in the Marines in World War II, but in
### his later years he had become almost a pacifist, opposing every war
### for one reason or another.
### The Quakers and the Jehovah's Witnesses are pacifist religious
### groups, and Henry David Thoreau and Martin Luther King are
### probably the most famous American pacifists. Like these groups and
### individuals, pacifists haven't always met with sympathy or
### understanding. Refusing to fight ever, for any reason, calls for strong
### faith in one's own moral or religious convictions, since pacifism
### during wartime has often gotten people persecuted and even thrown
### in prison.

### pact
### An agreement between two or more people or groups;
### a treaty or formal agreement between nations to deal with a
### problem or to resolve a dispute.
### • The girls made a pact never to reveal what had happened on that
### terrifying night in the abandoned house.
### Pact has “peace” at its root because a pact often ends a period of
### unfriendly relations. The word is generally used in the field of
### international relations, where diplomats may speak of an “arms
### pact,” a “trade pact,” or a “fishing-rights pact.” But it may also be
### used for any solemn agreement or promise between two people;
### after all, whenever two parties shake hands on a deal, they're not
### about to go to war with each other.

### pace
### Contrary to the opinion of.
### • She had only three husbands, pace some Hollywood historians who
### claim she had as many as six.
### This word looks like another that is much more familiar, but notice
### how it's pronounced. It is used only by intellectuals, and often
### printed in italics so that the reader doesn't mistake it for the other
### word. Writers use it when correcting an opinion that many people
### believe; for example, “The costs of the program, pace some
### commentators, will not be significant.” So what does pace have to do
### with peace? Because it says “Peace to them (that is, to the people
### I'm mentioning)—I don't want to start an argument; I just want to
### correct the facts.”

### CRIM
### comes from the Latin words for “fault or crime” or
### “accusation.” It's obvious where the root shows up most commonly
### in English. A crime is an act forbidden by the government, which the
### government itself will punish you for, and for which you may be
### branded a criminal. A crime is usually more serious than a tort (see
### TORT
### ), a “civil wrong” for which the wronged person must himself
### sue if he wants to get repaid in some way.

### criminology
### The study of crime, criminals, law
### enforcement, and punishment.
### • His growing interest in criminology led him to become a probation
### officer.
### Criminology includes the study of all aspects of crime and law
### enforcement—criminal psychology, the social setting of crime,
### prohibition and prevention, investigation and detection, capture and
### punishment. Thus, many of the people involved—legislators, social
### workers, probation officers, judges, etc.—could possibly be
### considered criminologists, though the word usually refers only to
### scholars and researchers.

### decriminalize
### To remove or reduce the criminal
### status of.
### • An angry debate over decriminalizing doctor-assisted suicide raged
### all day in the statehouse.
### Decriminalization of various “victimless crimes”—crimes that don't
### directly harm others, such as private gambling and drug-taking—has
### been recommended by conservatives as well as liberals, who often
### claim that it would ease the burden on the legal system, decrease
### the amount of money flowing to criminals, and increase personal
### liberty.
### Decriminalization
### is
### not
### the
### same
### as
### legalization;
### decriminalization may still call for a small fine (like a traffic ticket),
### and may apply only to use or possession of something, leaving the
### actual sale of goods or services illegal.

### incriminate
### To show evidence of involvement in a
### crime or a fault.
### • The muddy tracks leading to and from the cookie jar were enough
### to incriminate them.
### Testimony may incriminate a suspect by placing him at the scene of
### a crime, and incriminating evidence is the kind that strongly links
### him to it. But the word doesn't always refer to an actual crime. We
### can say, for instance, that a virus has been incriminated as the cause
### of a type of cancer, or that video games have been incriminated in
### the decline in study skills among young people.

### recrimination
### (1) An accusation in answer to
### an accusation made against oneself. (2) The making of such an
### accusation.
### • Their failure to find help led to endless and pointless recriminations
### over responsibility for the accident.
### Defending oneself from a verbal attack by means of a counterattack
### is as natural as physical self-defense. So a disaster often brings
### recriminations among those connected with it, and divorces and
### child-custody battles usually involve recriminations between husband
### and wife. An actual crime isn't generally involved, but it may be;
### when two suspects start exchanging angry recriminations after
### they've been picked up, it often leads to one of them turning against
### the other in court.

### PROB
### comes from the Latin words for “prove or proof” and
### “honesty or integrity.” A probe, whether it's a little object for testing
### electrical circuits or a spacecraft headed for Mars, is basically
### something that's looking for evidence or proof. And probable
### originally described something that wasn't certain but might be
### “provable.”

### approbation
### A formal or official act of approving;
### praise, usually given with pleasure or enthusiasm.
### • The senate signaled its approbation of the new plan by voting for it
### unanimously.
### Approbation is a noun form of approve, but approbation is usually
### stronger than mere approval. An official commendation for bravery is
### an example of approbation; getting reelected to office by a wide
### margin indicates public approbation; and the social approbation
### received by a star quarterback in high school usually makes all the
### pain worthwhile.

### probate
### The process of proving in court that the will of
### someone who has died is valid, and of administering the estate of a
### dead person.
### • When her father died, she thought she would be able to avoid
### probate, but she wasn't that lucky.
### Ever since people have written wills, those wills have had to be
### proven genuine by a judge. Without a probate process, greedy
### acquaintances or relatives could write up a fake will stating that all
### the person's wealth belonged to them. To establish a will as genuine,
### it must generally be witnessed and stamped by someone officially
### licensed to do so (though wills have sometimes been approved even
### when they were just written on a piece of scrap paper, with no
### witnesses). Today we use probate more broadly to mean everything
### that's handled in probate court, a special court that oversees the
### handling of estates (the money and property left when someone
### dies), making sure that everyone eventually receives what is
### properly theirs.

### probity
### Absolute honesty and uprightness.
### • Her unquestioned probity helped win her the respect of her fellow
### judges.
### Probity is a quality the public generally hopes for in its elected
### officials but doesn't always get. Bankers, for example, have
### traditionally been careful to project an air of probity, even though
### banking scandals and bailouts have made this harder than ever. An
### aura of probity surrounds such public figures as Warren Buffett and
### Bill Moyers, men to whom many Americans would entrust their
### children and their finances.

### reprobate
### A person of thoroughly bad character.
### • His wife finally left him, claiming he was a reprobate who would
### disappear for weeks at a time, gambling and drinking away all his
### money.
### The related verb of reprobate is reprove, which originally, as the
### opposite of approve, meant “to condemn.” Thus, a reprobate, as the
### word was used in Biblical translations, was someone condemned to
### hell. But for many years reprobate has been said in a tone of joshing
### affection, usually to describe someone of doubtful morals but good
### humor. Shakespeare's great character Falstaff—a lazy, lying, boastful,
### sponging drunkard—is the model of a reprobate, but still everyone's
### favorite Shakespeare character.

### GRAV
### comes from the Latin word meaning “heavy, weighty,
### serious.” Gravity is, of course, what makes things heavy, and without
### it there wouldn't be any life on earth, since nothing would stay on
### earth at all. This doesn't stop us from yelling in outrage when the
### familiar laws of gravity cause something to drop to the floor and
### break.

### grave
### (1) Requiring serious thought or concern. (2) Serious
### and formal in appearance or manner.
### • We realized that the situation was grave and that the slightest
### incident could spark all-out war.
### Gravity has a familiar physical meaning but also a nonphysical
### meaning—basically “seriousness.” Thus, something grave possesses
### gravity. You can refer to the gravity of a person's manner, though
### public figures today seem to have a lot less gravity than they used to
### have. Or you can talk about a grave situation, as in the example
### sentence. But even though Shakespeare makes a pun on grave
### when a dying character talks about being buried the next day (“Ask
### for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man”), the word
### meaning “hole for burying a body” isn't actually related.

### gravitas
### Great or very dignified seriousness.
### • The head of the committee never failed to carry herself with the
### gravitas she felt was appropriate to her office.
### This word comes to us straight from Latin. Among the Romans,
### gravitas was thought to be essential to the character and functions
### of any adult (male) in authority. Even the head of a household or a
### low-level official would strive for this important quality. We use
### gravitas today to identify the same solemn dignity in men and
### women, but it seems to come easier in those who are over 60, slow-
### moving—and a bit overweight.

### gravitate
### To move or be drawn toward something,
### especially by natural tendency or as if by an invisible force.
### • On hot evenings, the town's social life gravitated toward the
### lakefront, where you could stroll the long piers eating ice cream or
### dance at the old Casino.
### To gravitate is to respond, almost unconsciously, to a force that
### works like gravity to draw things steadily to it as if by their own
### weight. Thus, young people gravitate toward a role model, moths
### gravitate to a flame, a conversation might gravitate toward politics,
### and everyone at a party often gravitates to the bar.

### aggravate
### (1) To make (an injury, problem, etc.) more
### serious or severe. (2) To annoy or bother.
### • She went back to the soccer team before the knee was completely
### healed, which naturally aggravated the injury.
### Since the grav- root means basically “weighty or serious,” the
### original meaning of aggravate was “to make more serious.” A bad
### relationship with your parents can be aggravated by marrying
### someone who nobody likes, for example, or a touchy trade
### relationship between two countries can be aggravated by their
### inability to agree on climate-change issues. Depression can be
### aggravated by insomnia—and insomnia can be aggravated by
### depression. But when most people use aggravate today, they employ
### its “annoy” sense, as in “What really aggravates my dad is having to
### listen to that TV all day long.”

### LEV
### comes from the Latin adjective levis, meaning “light,” and the
### verb levare, meaning “to raise or lighten.” So a lever is a bar used to
### lift something, by means of leverage. And levitation is the magician's
### trick in which a body seems to rise into the air by itself.

### alleviate
### To lighten, lessen, or relieve, especially
### physical or mental suffering.
### • Cold compresses alleviated the pain of the physical injury, but only
### time could alleviate the effect of the insult.
### Physical pain or emotional anguish, or a water shortage or traffic
### congestion, can all be alleviated by providing the appropriate
### remedy. But some pain or anguish or shortage or congestion will
### remain: to alleviate is not to cure.

### elevation
### (1) The height of a place. (2) The act or
### result of lifting or raising someone or something.
### • Her doctor is concerned about the elevation of her blood pressure
### since her last visit.
### When you're hiking, you may be interested in knowing the highest
### elevation you'll be reaching. Psychologists use the term “mood
### elevation” to mean improvement in a patient's depression, and some
### leg ailments require elevation of the limb, usually so that it's higher
### than the heart for part of each day. Elevation can also mean
### “promotion”; thus, a vice president may be elevated to president, or
### a captain may be elevated to admiral.

### cantilever
### A long piece of wood, metal, etc., that
### sticks out from a wall to support something above it.
### • The house's deck, supported by cantilevers, jutted out dramatically
### over the rocky slope, and looking over the edge made him dizzy.
### Cantilevers hold up a surface or room without themselves being
### supported at their outer end. Many outdoor balconies are
### cantilevered, and theater balconies may be as well. A cantilevered
### bridge may have a huge span (as long as 1,800 feet) built out on
### either side of a single large foundation pier. Architects sometimes
### use cantilevered construction to produce dramatic effects; Frank
### Lloyd Wright's “Fallingwater” house, which extends out over a rocky
### river, is a famous example. But the Grand Canyon's “Skywalk” has
### become perhaps the best-known piece of cantilevered construction
### in America.

### levity
### Lack of appropriate seriousness.
### • The Puritan elders tried to ban levity of all sorts from the
### community's meetings, but found it increasingly difficult to control
### the younger generation.
### Levity originally was thought to be a physical force exactly like
### gravity but pulling in the opposite direction, like the helium in a
### balloon. As recently as the 19th century, scientists were still arguing
### about its existence. Today levity refers only to lightness in manner.
### To stern believers of some religious faiths, levity is often regarded as
### almost sinful. But the word, like its synonym frivolity, now has an
### old-fashioned ring to it and is usually used only half-seriously.

## Words from Mythology and History
### cicerone
### A guide, especially one who takes tourists
### to museums, monuments, or architectural sites and explains what is
### being seen.
### • On Crete they sought out a highly recommended cicerone, hoping
### to receive the best possible introduction to the noteworthy historical
### sites.
### The Roman statesman and orator Cicero was renowned for his
### elegant
### style
### and
### great
### knowledge
### (and
### occasional
### long-
### windedness). So 18th-century Italians seem to have given the name
### cicerone to the guides who would show well-educated foreigners
### around the great cultural sites of the ancient Roman empire—guides
### who sought to be as eloquent and informed as Cicero in explaining
### the world in which he lived.

### hector
### To bully or harass by bluster or personal pressure.
### • He would swagger around the apartment entrance with his friends
### and hector the terrified inhabitants going in and out.
### In Homer's great Iliad, Hector was the leader of the Trojan forces,
### and the very model of nobility and honor. In the Greek war against
### Troy, he killed several great warriors before being slain by Achilles.
### His name began to take on its current meaning only after gangs of
### bullying young rowdies, many of them armed soldiers recently
### released from service following the end of the English Civil War,
### began terrorizing the residents of late-17th-century London. The
### gangs took such names as the Roysters, the Blades, the Bucks, and
### the Bloods, but the best-known of them was called the Hectors. The
### names Blades and Hectors may have seemed appropriate because,
### like Hector and Achilles, they often fought with swords.

### hedonism
### An attitude or way of life based on the
### idea that pleasure or happiness should be the chief goal.
### • In her new spirit of hedonism, she went out for a massage, picked
### up champagne and chocolate truffles, and made a date that evening
### with an old boyfriend.
### Derived from the Greek word for “pleasure,” hedonism over the ages
### has provided the basis for several philosophies. The ancient
### Epicureans and the 19th-century Utilitarians both taught and
### pursued hedonistic principles. But although we generally use the
### word today when talking about immediate pleasures for the senses,
### philosophers who talk about hedonism are usually talking about
### quiet pleasures that aren't pursued in a selfish way.

### nestor
### A senior figure or leader in one's field.
### • The guest of honor was a nestor among journalists, and after
### dinner he shared some of his wisdom with the audience.
### Nestor was another character from the Iliad, the eldest of the Greek
### leaders in the Trojan War. A great warrior as a young man, he was
### now noted for his wisdom and his talkativeness, both of which
### increased as he aged. These days, a nestor is not necessarily long-
### winded, but merely wise and generous with his advice.

### spartan
### Marked by simplicity, avoidance of luxury, and
### often strict self-discipline or self-denial.
### • When he was single, he had lived a spartan life in a tiny,
### undecorated apartment with one chair, a table, and a bed.
### In ancient times, the Greek city-state of Sparta had a reputation for
### the severe and highly disciplined way of life it enforced among its
### citizens, so as to keep them ready for war at any time. Physical
### training was required for both men and women. A boy would begin
### his military training at 7 and would live in army barracks for much of
### his life, even after he was married. Today, when a cargo ship or a
### remote beach resort offers “spartan accommodations,” some tourists
### jump at the chance for a refreshing change from the luxuries they've
### been used to—and no one worries that they'll be forced out of bed
### at dawn to participate in war games.

### stentorian
### Extremely loud, often with especially
### deep richness of sound.
### • Even without a microphone, his stentorian voice was clearly
### audible in the last rows of the auditorium.
### Stentor, like Hector, was a warrior in the Iliad, but on the Greek side.
### His unusually powerful voice (Homer calls him “brazen-voiced”—that
### is, with a voice like a brass instrument) made him the natural choice
### for delivering announcements and proclamations to the assembled
### Greek army, in an era when there was no way of artificially
### increasing the volume of a voice.

### stoic
### Seemingly indifferent to pleasure or pain.
### • She bore the pain of her broken leg with such stoic patience that
### most of us had no idea she was suffering.
### The Stoics were members of a philosophical movement that first
### appeared in ancient Greece and lasted well into the Roman era.
### Stoicism taught that humans should seek to free themselves from
### joy, grief, and passions of all kinds in order to attain wisdom; its
### teachings thus have much in common with Buddhism. The great
### Stoics include the statesman Cicero, the playwright Seneca, and the
### emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose Meditations is the most famous
### book of Stoic philosophy. Today we admire the kind of stoicism that
### enables some people (who may never have even heard of Marcus
### Aurelius) to endure both mental and physical pain without complaint.

### sybaritic
### Marked by a luxurious or sensual way of life.
### • When I knew them they were living a sybaritic existence—hopping
### from resort to resort, each more splendid than the last—but a year
### later the money ran out.
### The ancient city of Sybaris (near modern Terranova di Sibari),
### founded by the Greeks on the toe of Italy's “boot,” was famous for
### the wealth and luxury of its citizens in the 6th century B.C. But the
### Sybarites' wealth made them overconfident, and when they went to
### war with a nearby city, they were defeated by a much smaller army.
### After the victory, their enemies diverted the course of the river
### running through Sybaris so that it destroyed the whole city forever.
