### MAND
### comes from mandare, Latin for “entrust” or “order.” A
### command is an order; a commandment is also an order, but usually
### one that comes from God. And a commando unit carries out orders
### for special military actions.

### mandate
### (1) A formal command. (2) Permission to act,
### given by the people to their representatives.
### • The new president claimed his landslide victory was a mandate
### from the voters to end the war.
### A mandate from a leader is a command you can't refuse. But that
### kind of personal command is rarely the meaning of mandate today;
### much more common are connected with institutions. Thus, the Clean
### Air Act was a mandate from Congress to clean up air pollution—and
### since mandate is also a verb, we could say instead that the Clear Air
### Act mandated new restrictions on air pollution. Elections are often
### interpreted as mandates from the public for certain kinds of action.
### But since a politician is not just a symbol of certain policies but also
### an individual who might happen to have an awfully nice smile, it can
### be risky to interpret most elections as mandating anything at all.

### mandatory
### Required.
### • If attendance at the meeting hadn't been mandatory, she would
### have just gone home.
### Something mandatory is the result of a mandate or order, which
### usually comes in the form of a law, rule, or regulation. Today there
### seem to be a lot of these mandates, so mandatory seat belts,
### mandatory inspections for industries, and mandatory prison
### sentences for violent crimes are regularly in the news. But
### mandatory retirement at age 65, which used to be common, is now
### illegal in most cases.

### commandeer
### To take possession of something by
### force, especially for military purposes.
### • No sooner had they started their meeting than the boss showed up
### and commandeered the conference room.
### Military forces have always had the power to commandeer houses.
### The Declaration of Independence complains about the way the
### British soldiers have done it, and the third Amendment to the
### Constitution states that the commandeering of people's houses shall
### be done only in a way prescribed by law. Almost anything—food,
### supplies, livestock, etc.—can be militarily commandeered when the
### need arises. But you don't have to be in the military for someone to
### “pull rank” on you: Your father may commandeer the car just when
### you were about to take it out for the evening, your teacher may
### commandeer your cell phone as you're texting in the middle of class,
### or your older sister may commandeer the TV remote to watch some
### lousy dancing competition.

### remand
### (1) To order a case sent back to another court or
### agency for further action. (2) To send a prisoner back into custody to
### await further trial or sentencing.
### • The state supreme court had remanded the case to the superior
### court, instructing it to consider the new evidence.
### Remand means “order back” or “send back.” After losing a case in a
### lower court, lawyers will frequently appeal it to a higher court. If the
### higher court looks at the case and sees that the lower court made
### certain kinds of errors, it will simply remand it, while telling the
### lower court how it fell short the first time: by not instructing the jury
### thoroughly, for example, or by not taking into account a recent
### related court decision.

### UND
### comes into English from the Latin words unda, “wave,” and
### undare, “to rise in waves,” “to surge or flood.” Undulations are waves
### or wavelike things or motions, and to undulate is to rise and fall in a
### wavelike way.

### undulant
### (1) Rising and falling in waves. (2) Wavy in
### form, outline, or surface.
### • The man's undulant, sinister movements reminded her of a
### poisonous snake about to strike.
### The surface of a freshly plowed field is undulant. A range of rolling
### hills could be called undulant, as could the shifting sands of the
### Sahara. A waterbed mattress is often literally undulant. And a field of
### wheat will undulate or sway in the wind, like the waves of the sea.

### inundate
### (1) To cover with a flood or overflow. (2) To
### overwhelm.
### • As news of the singer's death spread, retailers were inundated with
### orders for all his old recordings.
### In the summer of 1993, record rains in the Midwest caused the
### Mississippi River to overflow its banks, break through levees, and
### inundate the entire countryside; such an inundation hadn't been
### seen for at least a hundred years. By contrast, the Nile River
### inundated its entire valley every year, bringing the rich black silt that
### made the valley one of the most fertile places on earth. (The
### inundations ceased with the completion of the Aswan High Dam in
### 1970.) Whenever a critical issue is being debated, the White House
### and Congressional offices are inundated with phone calls and e-
### mails, just as a town may be inundated with complaints when it
### starts charging a fee for garbage pickup.

### redound
### (1) To have an effect for good or bad. (2) To
### rebound or reflect.
### • Each new military victory redounded to the glory of the king,
### whose brilliance as a leader was now praised and feared throughout
### Europe.
### Redound has had a confusing history. Its original meaning was
### simply “overflow.” But since the prefix re- often means “back,” the
### later meaning “result” may have arisen because flowing back—on a
### beach, for example—is a result of the original flowing. Redound has
### long been confused with other words such as resound and rebound,
### so today “rebound” is another of its standard meanings. As examples
### of its usual meaning, we could say that the prohibition of alcohol in
### 1919 redounded unintentionally to the benefit of gangsters such as
### Al Capone—and that Capone's jailing on tax-evasion charges
### redounded to the credit of the famous “Untouchables.”

### redundancy
### (1) The state of being extra or
### unnecessary. (2) Needless repetition.
### • A certain amount of redundancy can help make a speaker's points
### clear, but too much can be annoying.
### Redundancy, closely related to redound, has stayed close to the
### original meaning of “overflow” or “more than necessary.” Avoiding
### redundancy is one of the prime rules of good writing. ““In the
### modern world of today” contains a redundancy; so does “He died of
### fatal wounds” and “For the mutual benefit of both parties.” But
### redundancy doesn't just occur in language. “Data redundancy”
### means keeping the same computer data in more than one place as a
### safety measure, and a backup system in an airplane may provide
### redundancy, again for the sake of safety.

### Answers

### SANCT
### , meaning “holy,” comes from the Latin word sanctus. Thus,
### sanctity means “holiness.” In ancient Greece, a spot could be
### sanctified, or “made holy,” by a group of priests who carried out a
### solemn ritual; these might be spots where fumes arose from a crack
### in the earth or where a spring of clear water flowed out of the
### ground, and a temple might be built there for worship of a god.

### sanction
### To give approval to.
### • The bill's opponents claimed that removing criminal penalties for
### drug possession would amount to sanctioning drug use.
### Sanction originally meant “make holy” or “give official church
### approval to.” The word still has a solemn sound to it, so sanctioning
### is something generally done by an institution or government, though
### not necessarily by a church. So a college may sanction—or “give its
### blessing to”—the use of office space by a gay organization, or a hot-
### rod association may sanction two new tracks for official races. But
### sanction is also a noun, which may have two near-opposite
### meanings, “approval” and “penalty.” Thus, a company may be
### accused of giving its sanction to illegal activities. But when two or
### more countries impose sanctions on another country, it often
### involves cutting off trade. No wonder sanction is such a tricky word
### for so many of us.

### sanctimonious
### Pretending to be more
### religiously observant or morally better than other people.
### • The candidates' speeches were sanctimonious from beginning to
### end, filled with stories about how their deep faith was the basis for
### everything they did.
### Making a show of your religious morality has always struck some
### people the wrong way, including Jesus. In his Sermon on the Mount,
### Jesus preaches that, when we give away money for charity, we
### shouldn't let our left hand know what our right hand is doing—that
### is, the giving should be done for its own sake and other people
### shouldn't be told about it. Those who make a display of how good
### and pious they are called hypocrites. But sanctimony, or
### sanctimoniousness, has often been a good strategy for American
### politicians, many of whom have found it a great way to win votes.

### sacrosanct
### (1) Most sacred or holy. (2) Treated as
### if holy and therefore immune from criticism or disturbance of any
### kind.
### • Lots of experts have criticized the governor's education program,
### but it's regarded as sacrosanct by members of her own party.
### Sacrosanct means literally “made holy by a sacred rite,” and in its
### original use the word was reserved for things of the utmost holiness.
### But sacrosanct is now used to describe a questionable sacredness
### which nevertheless makes something immune from attack or
### violation; that is, the person using the word usually doesn't regard
### the thing as sacred at all. So to call a government program
### sacrosanct is to imply that others regard it as untouchable. And a
### piece of writing is more likely to be thought of as sacrosanct by its
### author than by the editor who has to fix it up.

### sanctuary
### (1) A holy place, such as a church or
### temple, or the most holy part of one. (2) A place of safety, refuge,
### and protection.
### • The midtown park is a tranquil sanctuary amidst the city's heat,
### noise, and bustle.
### Historically, churches have been places where fugitives could seek at
### least temporary protection from the law. In Anglo-Saxon England,
### churches and churchyards generally provided 40 days of immunity,
### and neither the sheriffs nor the army would enter to seize the
### outlaw. But gradually the right of sanctuary was eroded. In 1486
### sanctuary for the crime of treason was disallowed, and sanctuary for
### most other crimes was severely restricted by Henry VIII and later
### abolished. In the 1980s many U.S. churches provided sanctuary to
### political refugees from Central America, and the U.S. government
### mostly chose not to interfere. Today, wildlife sanctuaries provide
### protection for the species within its boundaries, and farm-animal
### sanctuaries now rescue livestock from abuse and starvation.

### LOQU
### comes from the Latin verb loqui, “to talk.” An eloquent
### preacher speaks fluently, forcefully, and expressively. And a dummy's
### words come out of a ventriloquist's mouth—or perhaps out of his
### belly (in Latin, venter).

### colloquium
### A conference in which various
### speakers take turns lecturing on a subject and then answering
### questions about it.
### • There's a colloquium at Yale on Noah Webster in September, where
### she's scheduled to deliver a paper.
### A colloquy is a conversation, and especially an important, high-level
### discussion. Colloquy and colloquium once meant the same thing,
### though today colloquium always refers to a conference. Because of
### its old “conversation” meaning, however, a colloquium is a type of
### conference with important question-and-answer periods.

### soliloquy
### A dramatic speech that represents a series
### of unspoken thoughts.
### • Film characters never have onscreen soliloquies, though they may
### tell us their thoughts in a voiceover.
### Since solus means “alone” in Latin, soliloquies take place when a
### character is alone onstage, or maybe spotlighted off to one side of a
### dark stage. Novels have no trouble in expressing to the reader a
### character's personal thoughts, but such expression is less natural to
### stage drama. The soliloquies of Shakespeare—in Hamlet (“To be or
### not to be”), Macbeth (“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow”),
### Romeo and Juliet (“But soft! what light from yonder window
### breaks”), etc.—are the most famous, but modern playwrights such
### as Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, and Sam Shepard have also
### employed them.

### colloquial
### Conversational in style.
### • The author, though obviously a professional writer, uses a
### colloquial style in this new book.
### Since colloquy means basically “conversation,” colloquial language is
### the language almost all of us speak. It uses contractions (“can't,”
### “it's,” “they've”), possibly some slang, lots of short words and not
### many long ones. But our language usually changes when we write,
### becoming more formal and sometimes even “literary.” Except in e-
### mails and text messages, many people never write a contraction or
### use the word “I”, and avoid informal words completely. But colloquial
### language isn't necessarily bad in writing, and it's sometimes more
### appropriate than the alternative.

### loquacious
### Apt to talk too much; talkative.
### • She had hoped to read quietly on the plane, but the loquacious
### salesman in the next seat made it nearly impossible.
### A loquacious speaker can leave a big audience stifling its yawns after
### the first 45 minutes, and the loquaciousness of a dinner guest can
### keep everyone else from getting a word in edgewise. Loquacious
### letters used to go on for pages, and a loquacious author might
### produce a 1,200-page novel. Lincoln's brief 269-word Gettysburg
### Address was delivered after a two-hour, 13,000-word speech by
### America's most famous orator, a windbag of loquacity.

### VIR
### is Latin for “man.” A virtue is a good quality—originally, the kind
### of quality an ideal man possessed. And virtuous behavior is morally
### excellent. All in all, the Romans seem to have believed that being a
### man was a good thing.

### virility
### Energetic, vigorous manhood; masculinity.
### • For his entire life he believed that anyone who had been a Marine
### had established his virility beyond any doubt.
### Luckily, there's no doubt about what virility is, since it's depicted on
### the covers of dozens of new romance novels every month! A
### masterful and dominating manner, a splendid bared chest, a full
### head of lustrous hair, and an array of stunning costumes seem to be
### what's required. (Virile traits often missing in these men are hair on
### the chest and any hint of future baldness.) High-school football
### provides a showplace for demonstrations of adolescent virility, and
### for years afterward virile high-school players can keep using football
### language in their business life: “get to the red zone,” “Hail Mary
### pass,” “move the ball,” and on and on.

### triumvirate
### (1) A commission or government of
### three. (2) A group or association of three.
### • A triumvirate slowly emerged as the inner circle of the White
### House, and the vice president wasn't among them.
### The first triumvirate of the Roman Republic, which consisted of
### Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, was simply an alliance or
### partnership, not a formal institution of the government. The alliance
### didn't last long, however, and Caesar eventually emerged with total
### power. This led to his assassination, after which a second triumvirate
### took over, with Octavian, Mark Antony, and Lepidus dividing the
### Roman world among themselves. But these triumvirs also soon
### turned on one another, with Octavian alone taking power; in time he
### would become Rome's first emperor.

### virago
### A loud, bad-tempered, overbearing woman.
### • The staff called her a virago and other things behind her back, but
### everyone was respectful of her abilities.
### The original Latin meaning of virago was “female warrior.” But in
### later centuries the meaning shifted toward the negative. The most
### famous virago in English literature is the ferocious Kate in
### Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Some historical viragoes
### have also become famous. Agrippina poisoned her husband, the
### Emperor Claudius, so that her son Nero could take his place (but it
### was Nero himself who eventually had her assassinated). And Queen
### Eleanor of Aquitaine, a powerful virago of the 12th century, was
### imprisoned by her husband, King Henry II of England, after she
### encouraged their sons to rebel against him. Today some people are
### beginning to use virago admiringly again.

### virtuosity
### Great technical skill, especially in the
### practice of a fine art.
### • Playing with the band, his virtuosity doesn't show through; you
### really have to hear him solo to appreciate him.
### Virtuosity is used particularly to describe musicians, but also often
### for writers, actors, dancers, and athletes. A virtuoso is a highly
### skilled performer, and a virtuoso performance is one that astonishes
### the audience by its feats. In ancient Greece the cities would hold
### male competitions in acrobatics, conjuring, public reciting, blowing
### the trumpet, and acting out scenes from Homer's epics, the winners
### of which would have been praised as virtuous, or “full of manly
### virtues.”

### VAL
### has as its basic meaning “strength,” from the Latin verb valere,
### meaning “to be worthy, healthy, or strong” and “to have power or
### influence.” So evaluating a house involves determining how healthy
### it is. A valid license or credit card is one that's still in effect, and a
### valid proof is one that provides strong evidence.

### valor
### Personal bravery in the face of danger.
### • The gun duels of the Old West were invented by a novelist inspired
### by the valor of the knights in medieval tournaments.
### Valor in uniform is still rewarded by medals. Many American civic
### organizations award a Medal of Valor for physical courage, and the
### Air Force Medal of Honor displays the single word “Valor.” The
### somewhat old-fashioned adjective valorous more often describes
### warriors of the past. But valiant is still in common use, though it less
### often describes military courage than other kinds of bravery or
### effort.

### equivalent
### (1) Equal in force, amount, value, area,
### or volume. (2) Similar or virtually identical in effect or function.
### • A square can be equivalent to a triangle in area, but not in shape.
### Modern democracies have institutions and offices that are roughly
### equivalent to those found in others: the president of the United
### States has his British equivalent in the prime minister, for instance,
### and the U.S. Congress finds its equivalent in the British Parliament.
### The heavily armored knight on his great armored horse has been
### called the Middle Ages' equivalent of the army tank. In none of these
### examples are the two things identical to each other; they're simply
### very similar in their effect or purpose or nature, which is what
### equivalence usually implies.

### prevalent
### Widely accepted, favored, or practiced;
### widespread.
### • On some campuses Frisbees seem to be more prevalent than
### schoolbooks, especially in the spring.
### Many diseases that were prevalent a century ago have been
### controlled by advances in medicine. Smallpox was prevalent on
### several continents for many centuries, and when Europeans brought
### it with them to the Americas, it killed more American Indians than
### the armed settlers did. But prevalent doesn't just describe diseases.
### One ideal of male or female beauty may be prevalent in a particular
### society and quite a different ideal in another. In the 1950s and '60s,
### there was a prevalent notion that if you went swimming less than an
### hour after eating you might drown because of stomach cramps—
### which goes to show that not every prevalent idea is exactly true.

### validate
### (1) To make legally valid; give official approval
### to. (2) To support or confirm the validity of.
### • It will take many more research studies to validate a theory as far-
### reaching as this one.
### Validating a pass might require getting an official stamp on it.
### Validating experimental data might require checking it against data
### from further experiments. An A on a test might validate your study
### methods. And you might go to a trusted friend to validate your
### decision to get rid of your boyfriend, buy a pet iguana, or sell
### everything and move to Las Vegas.

### Answers

### CRE/CRET
### comes from the Latin verb crescere, which means both
### “to come into being” and “to grow.” So a crescendo in music occurs
### when the music is growing louder, and a decrescendo when it's
### growing softer.

### crescent
### (1) The moon between the new moon and first
### quarter, and between the last quarter and the next new moon. (2)
### Anything shaped like the crescent moon.
### • The symbol of Islam is a crescent moon with a star between the
### points, an astronomical impossibility.
### Crescent means basically “growing,” since a crescent moon is in the
### process of “growing” to a full moon. A crescent wrench, with its
### open end (unlike the kind of wrench that has an almost circular
### end), can be found in almost any household. A croissant, or crescent
### pastry, is a breakfast staple. The curving region called the Fertile
### Crescent, which stretches from the Persian Gulf up through Iraq,
### across to Lebanon and Israel, and down into Egypt's Nile River
### valley, was the birthplace of civilization, where weaving, pottery,
### domesticated livestock, irrigation farming, and writing all first
### appeared.

### accretion
### (1) Growth or enlargement by gradual
### buildup. (2) A product of such buildup.
### • The house and barn were linked by an accretion of outbuildings,
### each joined to the next.
### The slow accretion of scientific knowledge over many centuries has
### turned into an avalanche in our time. Any accretion of ice on a
### grounded jet will result in takeoff delays because of the danger it
### poses. The land area of the Mississippi Delta increases every year
### from the accretion of soil washed down the Mississippi River, though
### the accretions happen so slowly that it's difficult to detect any
### increase at all. Accretion is often used in scientific writing; its usual
### verb form, accrue, is more often used in financial contexts (“This
### figure doesn't count the accrued interest on the investments”).

### excrescence
### (1) A projection of growth, especially
### when abnormal. (2) A disfiguring, unnecessary, or unwanted mark or
### part.
### • The new warehouse squatted like some hideous excrescence on
### the landscape.
### Warts and pimples are common excrescences that can usually be
### wiped out with medication; other excrescences such as cysts and
### tumors need to be removed surgically. Mushrooms are the
### excrescences of underground fungus networks. Some people
### consider slang words to be vulgar excrescences on the English
### language, but others consider slang the most colorful vocabulary of
### all.

### increment
### (1) Something gained or added,
### especially as one of a series of regular additions or as a tiny increase
### in amount. (2) The amount or extent of change, especially the
### positive or negative change in value of one or more variables.
### • Her bank account has grown weekly by increments of $50 for the
### past two years.
### Increment is used in many technical fields, but also nontechnically.
### Incremental increases in drug dosages are used for experimental
### purposes. Incremental tax increases are easier to swallow than
### sudden large increases. Incremental changes of any kind may be
### hard to notice, but can be very significant in the long run. Rome
### wasn't built in a day, but was instead built up by increments from a
### couple of villages in the 10th century B.C. to the capital of the
### Mediterranean world in the 1st century A.D.

### FUS
### comes from the Latin verb fundere, “to pour out” or “to melt.” A
### fuse depends on melting metal to break an overloaded circuit.
### Nuclear fusion involves the “melting” together of light nuclei to form
### heavier nuclei, and fusion cuisine brings together the cooking of two
### or more cultures.

### transfusion
### (1) The process of transferring a
### fluid and especially blood into a blood vessel. (2) Something
### transfused.
### • The transfusion gave her an immediate burst of energy, and her
### friends were astonished when they arrived at the hospital that
### afternoon.
### When blood transfusions were first attempted by Europeans in the
### early 1600s, they were met with skepticism, since the established
### practice was to bleed patients, not transfuse them with blood. Some
### patients were transfused with animal blood, and so many died as a
### result that by 1700 transfusions had been widely outlawed. Not until
### 1900 were the major blood groups (A, B, AB, and O) recognized,
### making transfusions safe and effective.

### effusive
### (1) Given to excessive display of feeling. (2)
### Freely expressed.
### • At the victory party she lavished effusive praise on all her
### supporters for almost half an hour.
### Since to effuse is to “pour out,” an effusive person makes a habit of
### pouring out emotions. Greeting someone effusively may include
### great hugs and wet kisses. Academy Award winners tend to become
### embarrassingly effusive once they've got the microphone. But at
### least effusiveness is generally an expression of positive rather than
### negative emotions.

### profusion
### Great abundance.
### • In May the trees and flowers bloom with almost delirious
### profusion.
### A profusion is literally a “pouring forth,” so a profusion of gifts is a
### wealth or abundance of gifts. A profusely illustrated book is filled to
### overflowing with pictures. A bad social error should be followed by
### profuse apologies, and profound gratitude should be expressed with
### profuse thanks.

### suffuse
### To spread over or fill something, as if by fluid or
### light.
### • As the soft light of dawn suffused the landscape, they could hear
### the loons crying over the lake.
### The odors of baking may suffuse a room, and so may the light of a
### sunset. A face may be suffused (that is, filled, but also probably
### flushed) with joy, or hope, or love. A novel may be suffused with
### Irish humor, and a room may be suffused with firelight. Scientists
### may even describe an insect's gray wings as being suffused with
### tinges of red.

## Greek and Latin Borrowings
### apologia
### A defense, especially of one's own ideas,
### opinions, or actions.
### • His resignation speech was an eloquent apologia for his
### controversial actions as chairman.
### An apologia and an apology usually aren't the same thing. An
### apology includes an admission of wrongdoing, but an apologia rarely
### apologizes in this sense, instead seeking to justify what was done.
### So, for example, in 1992 some of the books published for the 500th
### anniversary of Columbus's voyage were apologias explaining why
### European powers such as Spain acted as they did in the New World:
### because, for example, the Aztecs were a cruel people, practicing
### human sacrifice in grotesque ways (victims were skinned, and their
### skins were worn by the high priests), and Christianity hoped to
### reform them. Of course, the Spanish Inquisition was torturing and
### executing nonbelievers at the same time—but that would be the
### subject of other apologias.

### atrium
### (1) An open rectangular patio around which a
### house is built. (2) A court with a skylight in a many-storied building.
### • Best of all, their new home had a large atrium, where they could
### eat breakfast in the fresh air in spring and summer.
### In malls and grand office buildings today, the enclosed atrium, often
### with full-size trees growing in it and high indoor balconies with
### hanging vines, has become a common architectural feature. But the
### original atria (notice the unusual plural) were open to the sky and
### occupied the center of a house or villa in ancient Rome. The open
### Roman courtyard allowed air to circulate and light to enter, and even
### its plantings helped cool the house. Situating the cooking fireplace in
### the atrium was another way of keeping the house itself cool. Still
### today, houses around the Mediterranean Sea and in tropical Latin
### America often have internal courtyards.

### oligarchy
### A government in which power is in the
### hands of a small group.
### • The population was shackled by an iron-willed oligarchy that
### dictated every aspect of their lives and ruthlessly crushed any hint of
### rebellion.
### Oligarchy combines roots from the Greek words oligos, meaning
### “few,” and archos, meaning “leader or ruler.” In ancient Greece, an
### aristocracy was government by the “best” (in Greek, aristos) citizens.
### An oligarchy was a corrupted aristocracy, one in which a few evil
### men unjustly seized power and used it to further their own ends.
### Since at least 1542, oligarchy has been used in English to describe
### oppressive governments of the kind that serve the interests of a few
### very wealthy families.

### encomium
### Glowing, enthusiastic praise, or an
### expression of such praise.
### • The surprise guest at the farewell party was the school's most
### famous graduate, who delivered a heartfelt encomium to the woman
### he called his favorite teacher of all.
### Encomium comes straight from Latin. Mark Antony's encomium to
### the dead Caesar in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar (“Friends, Romans,
### countrymen, lend me your ears”) is one of the most famous
### encomiums of all time, while Ben Jonson's encomium to the dead
### Shakespeare (“He was not of an age, but for all time”) has also been
### widely read and discussed. The British poet laureate is expected to
### compose poetic encomiums to mark special events or to praise a
### person honored by the state. And any awards banquet is thick with
### encomiums, with each speaker trying to outdo the last in praise of
### those being honored.

### neurosis
### A mental and emotional disorder that is less
### severe than a psychosis and may involve various pains, anxieties, or
### phobias.
### • He has a neurosis about dirt, and is constantly washing his hands.
### A neurosis is a somewhat mild mental disorder; unexplained anxiety
### attacks, unreasonable fears, depression, and physical symptoms that
### are mentally caused are all examples of neurotic conditions. A
### superstitious person who compulsively knocks on wood or avoids
### anything with the number 13 might be suffering from a harmless
### neurosis. But a severe neurosis such as agoraphobia (see
### agoraphobia
### ) can be very harmful, making a person a prisoner of his
### or her home. Neurosis is based on the Greek word for “nerve,” since
### until quite recently neurotic behavior was often blamed on the
### nerves. Neurosis is usually contrasted with psychosis, which includes
### a considerably more serious group of conditions.

### opprobrium
### (1) Something that brings disgrace.
### (2) A public disgrace that results from conduct considered wrong or
### bad.
### • The writers of the New Testament hold the Pharisees up to
### opprobrium for their hypocrisy and hollow spirituality.
### Witches have long been the objects of opprobrium; in Europe in the
### 16th and 17th centuries, women thought to be witches were burned
### by the thousands. The opprobrious crime of treason could likewise
### result in the most hideous torture and execution. In The Scarlet
### Letter, the sin of adultery in Puritan times brought opprobrium on
### Hester Prynne. Today the country of Israel is the object of
### opprobrium in many countries, while the Palestinians suffer similar
### opprobrium in others. And mere smokers, or even overweight
### people, may sometimes feel themselves to be the objects of mild
### opprobrium.

### referendum
### (1) The referring of legislative
### measures to the voters for approval or rejection. (2) A vote on such
### a measure.
### • The referendum on the tax needed for constructing the new
### hospital passed by seven votes.
### Referendum is a Latin word, but its modern meaning only dates from
### the 19th century, when a new constitution adopted by Switzerland
### stated that the voters could vote directly on certain issues. Thus, a
### referendum is a measure that's referred (that is, sent on) to the
### people. Since the U.S. Constitution doesn't provide for referenda
### (notice the common plural form) at the national level, referenda tend
### to be on local and state issues. In most locales, a few questions
### usually appear on the ballot at election time, often involving such
### issues as new zoning ordinances, new taxes for schools, and new
### limits on spending.

### ultimatum
### A final proposal, condition, or demand,
### especially one whose rejection will result in forceful action.
### • The ultimatum to Iraq in 1991 demanding that it withdraw from
### Kuwait was ignored, and a U.S.-led invasion was the response.
### An ultimatum is usually issued by a stronger power to a weaker one,
### since it wouldn't carry much weight if the one giving the ultimatum
### couldn't back up its threat. Near the end of World War II, the Allied
### powers issued an ultimatum to Japan: surrender completely or face
### the consequences. Japan rejected the ultimatum, and within days
### the U.S. had dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
### killing some 200,000 people.
