### PUT
### comes from the Latin verb putare, meaning “to think, consider,
### or believe.” So, for example, a reputation is what others think of you.
### But when the root shows up in such words as compute, dispute, and
### deputy, its meaning is harder to trace.

### reputed
### Believed to be a certain way by popular
### opinion.
### • The 15th-century prince Vlad the Impaler is reputed to have
### inspired the character Dracula, though in fact, evil though Vlad was,
### Dracula's creator only borrowed his nickname.
### Reputed is used constantly today by reporters, and almost always to
### describe suspected criminals—“the reputed mobster,” “the reputed
### drug kingpin,” “the reputed gang leader,” etc. But the word shouldn't
### be left to journalists; your elderly aunt may, for instance, be reputed
### to have made a large fortune in oil, or to have had four husbands
### who all died mysteriously. Reputed is easy to confuse with reputable,
### and they used to mean the same thing—that is, “having a good
### reputation”—but it's become rare to hear reputed used with that
### meaning today.

### disrepute
### Loss or lack of good reputation; disgrace.
### • The family had fallen into disrepute after the conviction and
### imprisonment of his father and uncle.
### A reputation can be easy to lose, and someone who is no longer
### respectable may eventually find he's become genuinely disreputable
### —the kind of person that almost no one wants to be seen with.
### Disrepute isn't only for individuals: A company may fall into
### disrepute as a result of news stories about its products' defects;
### drug scandals have brought entire sports into disrepute; and a
### scientific theory may fall into disrepute as a result of new
### discoveries.

### impute
### To attribute.
### • The British imputed motives of piracy to American ships trying to
### prevent them from interfering with American trade during the War of
### 1812.
### Imputing something to someone (or something) usually means
### observing something invisible in that person (or thing). We may
### impute meaning to a play or novel, or to a casual remark by a friend,
### that was never intended. Many of us like to impute bad motives to
### others, while always regarding our own motives as pure. In tax law,
### imputed income is something that isn't actual money but might as
### well be—for example, the free use of a car lent to you by your
### employer.

### putative
### Generally supposed; assumed to exist.
### • To strengthen the case for the defense, a putative expert took the
### stand.
### Putative is almost always used to express doubt or skepticism about
### a common belief. Thus, Tintagel Castle in Cornwall, a picturesque
### ruin, is the putative fortress of the medieval King Arthur. The
### residents of New York City are putatively chic, neurotic, rude, and
### dangerous. And cable TV is full of putative experts, who often turn
### out not to have much knowledge of the subjects they're talking
### about.

### LOG
### , from the Greek word logos, meaning “word,” “speech,” or
### “reason,” is found particularly in English words that end in -logy and
### -logue. The ending -logy often means “the study of”; so, for
### instance, biology is the study of life, and anthropology is the study
### of humans. And -logue usually indicates a type of discussion; thus,
### dialogue is conversation between two people or groups, and an
### epilogue is an author's last words on a subject. But exceptions aren't
### hard to find.

### physiology
### (1) A branch of biology dealing with the
### processes and activities by which living things, tissues, and cells
### function. (2) The life processes and activities of a living thing or any
### of its parts.
### • For students planning to go to medical school, the university's
### most popular major is Human Physiology.
### The Latin root physio- generally means “physical,” so human
### physiology deals with just about everything that keeps us alive and
### working, and other physiology specialties do the same for other
### animals and for plants. To do anything serious in the field of health,
### you've obviously got to know how the body's organs and cells
### function normally. Physiology used to be considered separately from
### anatomy, which focuses on the body's structures; however, it's now
### known that structure and function can't easily be separated in a
### scientific way, so “anatomy and physiology” are often spoken of in
### the same breath.

### methodology
### A set of methods or rules
### followed in a science or field.
### • Some researchers claimed that Dr. Keller's methodology was sloppy
### and had led to unreliable conclusions.
### The methodology employed in an experiment is essential to its
### success, and bad methodology has spoiled thousands of research
### projects. So whenever a piece of research is published in a scientific
### or medical journal, the researchers always carefully describe their
### methodology; otherwise, other scientists couldn't possibly judge the
### quality of what they've done.

### ideology
### The set of ideas and beliefs of a group or
### political party.
### • By the time she turned 19, she realized she no longer believed in
### her family's political ideology.
### The root ideo-, as you might guess, means “idea.” Ideas and
### theories about human behavior can always be carried too far, since
### such behavior is very hard to pin down. So ideological thinkers—
### people who come up with large theories about how the world works
### and try to explain everything (and maybe even predict the future)
### according to those theories—are almost always disappointed, sooner
### or later, to find that it doesn't really work out. A person intensely
### devoted to a set of political ideas or theories can be called an
### ideologue—a translation of the French idéologue, a word actually
### coined by Napoleon as a label for those political thinkers full of ideas
### he had no use for.

### cardiology
### The study of the heart and its action
### and diseases.
### • After his heart attack, he actually bought himself a cardiology
### textbook and set about learning everything he could about his
### unreliable organ.
### The root card- (closely related to cord—see
### CORD
### ) shows up in
### many heart-related words. Cardiologists frequently find themselves
### studying cardiograms, the charts of heart activity, made by machines
### called cardiographs. Heart attacks, and deaths caused by them, have
### both declined as a result of better medical emergency procedures,
### cholesterol-lowering drugs, and a decline in smoking. But the factors
### likely to actually improve heart health, such as better diets and more
### cardiovascular exercise (exercise, such as running, that improves the
### heart and blood vessels), haven't made any progress at all. So we
### should all be prepared to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (an
### emergency procedure done on someone whose heart has stopped,
### to get the heart and lungs working again).

### TERR
### comes from the Latin terra, “earth.” A territory is a large
### expanse of land. Terra firma is Latin for “firm ground” as opposed to
### the swaying seas. A terrace is a leveled area, often one created for
### farming on a sloping hill. And the French word for potato, pomme de
### terre, means literally “apple of the earth.”

### parterre
### (1) A decorative garden with paths between the
### beds of plants. (2) The back area of the ground floor of a theater,
### often under the balcony.
### • The city's park boasts a beautiful parterre with many varieties of
### roses.
### Parterre comes to English by way of French, where it means “on the
### ground.” And in the early years of the theater, the parterre was truly
### on the ground. In Shakespeare's day, an English theater's parterre
### was the cheap standing-room area right in front of the stage,
### normally filled with rowdy spectators. The original idea of the French
### parterre garden, with its carefully designed plots and walkways, was
### to present an artistic pattern when seen from above—from a
### balcony, a raised terrace, or the top of an outdoor staircase. English
### gardeners responded with garden designs that tried to make their
### viewers half-forget that they were seeing something created by
### humans rather than untamed nature itself.

### subterranean
### Underground.
### • In Carlsbad Caverns National Park there is an astonishing
### subterranean chamber over half a mile long.
### A tunnel is a subterranean road or pathway, and a subway is a
### subterranean railway. The subterranean vaults at Fort Knox hold
### billions of dollars of gold reserves. Subterranean reservoirs called
### aquifers are tapped for water; in places where the pressure on the
### subterranean water is great enough, a hole drilled in the ground will
### bring it bubbling to the surface.

### terrarium
### An enclosure, usually transparent, with a
### layer of dirt in the bottom in which plants and sometimes small
### animals are kept indoors.
### • When no one was watching, they dropped their snake in the fifth-
### grade terrarium, and then waited in the hall to hear the screams.
### The turtle exhibit at a zoo is often in the form of a terrarium, as are
### some of the exhibits at a plant conservatory. In an ant terrarium,
### elementary-school students watch the ants dig their network of
### tunnels as if no one were watching. Terrariums try to create
### conditions as close as possible to a natural habitat. A covered
### terrarium can often sustain itself for months on the moisture trapped
### inside. But creating a good terrarium requires careful control not
### only of humidity but also of temperature, as well as good ventilation;
### the lighting should include the full spectrum of sunlight as well as a
### day-night regulator.

### terrestrial
### (1) Having to do with Earth or its
### inhabitants. (2) Living or growing on land instead of in water or air.
### • The roadrunner, although a largely terrestrial bird, can take flight
### for short periods when necessary.
### Everything on or having to do with Earth can be called terrestrial.
### Mercury, Venus, and Mars are often called the terrestrial planets,
### since they are rocky balls somewhat like Earth rather than great
### globes of gas like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Something
### extraterrestrial comes from beyond the earth and its atmosphere;
### the word can be used to describe anything “out of this world,” from
### moon rocks to meteors. Turning to the second sense of terrestrial,
### animals are often divided into the terrestrial (land-living) and the
### aquatic (water-living). And sometimes terrestrial animals are
### contrasted with arboreal animals, those that live in trees.

### MAR
### , from the Latin word mare, meaning “sea,” brings its salty tang
### to several English words. A submarine is an undersea ship. Marine
### means basically “relating to the sea,” so when the Continental
### Marines were established back in 1775, their job was to provide on-
### board security on naval ships; but they immediately began to be
### used on land as well, and the marines have continued to operate on
### both land and sea ever since.

### marina
### A dock or harbor where pleasure boats can be
### moored securely, often with facilities offering supplies or repairs.
### • The coast of Florida has marinas all along it for the use of anything
### from flimsy sailboats to enormous yachts.
### Marina comes straight from Latin, where it means simply “of the
### sea.” At a modern marina, sailors can acquire whatever they need
### for their next excursion, or they can tie up their boats until the next
### weekend comes along. Some even imitate John D. MacDonald's
### famous detective hero Travis McGee, who lives on his boat in Miami
### and rarely leaves the marina.

### aquamarine
### (1) A transparent blue or blue-green
### gem. (2) A pale blue or greenish blue that is the color of clear
### seawater in sunlight.
### • Many of the houses on the Italian Riviera are painted aquamarine
### to match the Mediterranean.
### Aqua marina is Latin for “seawater,” so when a lovely blue-green
### form of the semiprecious gem known as beryl was given an English
### name several centuries ago, aquamarine seemed appropriate.
### Aquamarine is the ideal color that most of us carry around in our
### heads when we imagine the waters that lap the shores of the Greek
### and Caribbean islands on a sunny day. But even the Mediterranean
### and the Caribbean can take on lots of other colors depending on
### weather conditions.

### mariner
### A seaman or sailor.
### • When he signed on as a mariner, the young Ishmael never
### suspected that the ship would be pursuing a great white whale.
### In Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner, an old seaman tells of
### how, by shooting a friendly albatross, he had brought storms and
### disaster to his ship, and how as punishment his shipmates hung the
### great seabird around the mariner's neck and made him wear it until
### it rotted. The word mariner has occasionally been used to mean
### simply “explorer,” as in the famous Mariner spaceflights in the 1960s
### and '70s, the first to fly close to Mars, Venus, and Mercury.

### maritime
### (1) Bordering on or having to do with the
### sea. (2) Having to do with navigation or commerce on the sea.
### • As a result of the ocean, Canada's Maritime Provinces—New
### Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island—have a late
### spring but a mild winter.
### The maritime countries of Portugal and England produced many
### seafaring explorers during the 16th and 17th centuries, many of
### whom sailed under the flags of other countries. Sailing for the
### Spanish, Ferdinand Magellan captained the ship that was the first to
### circle the world, charting many new maritime routes as it went.
### Henry Hudson, funded by the Dutch, sailed up what we call today
### the Hudson River, claiming the maritime area that now includes New
### York City for the Netherlands.

### PATH
### comes from the Greek word pathos, which means “feeling” or
### “suffering.” So a pathetic sight moves us to pity, and a sympathetic
### friend “feels with” you when you yourself are suffering.

### pathos
### (1) An element in life or drama that produces
### sympathetic pity. (2) An emotion of sympathetic pity.
### • The pathos of the blind child beggars she had seen in India could
### still keep her awake at night.
### Pathos comes directly from Greek. According to Aristotle, the
### persuasive power of public speaking relies on three elements: the
### speaker's authority, the logic of the speech, and the speech's pathos.
### Aristotle claims that pathos is the appeal to the audience's sense of
### right and wrong, and that it is this (unlike authority and logic) that
### moves the audience's emotions. Today we usually speak of pathos
### as an element in fiction, film, drama, music, or even painting, or the
### real-life pathos of a situation or personality. Since pathos is closely
### related to pathetic, it's not surprising that, like pathetic, pathos may
### occasionally be used a bit sarcastically.

### apathetic
### (1) Showing or feeling little or no
### emotion. (2) Having no interest.
### • His apathetic response to the victory bewildered his friends.
### Apathy, or lack of emotion, is central to Albert Camus's famous novel
### The Stranger, in which the main character's indifference toward
### almost everything, including his mother's death, results in his
### imprisonment. We feel little sympathy for him, and may even feel
### antipathy, or dislike. The American voter is often called apathetic; of
### all the industrial democracies, only in America does half the adult
### population fail to vote in major elections. As you can see, apathetic
### isn't the opposite of pathetic, even though the a- that it begins with
### means “not” or “without.”

### empathy
### The feeling of, or the ability to feel, the
### emotions and sensations of another.
### • Her maternal empathy was so strong that she often seemed to be
### living her son's life emotionally.
### In the 19th century, Charles Dickens counted on producing an
### empathetic response in his readers strong enough to make them buy
### the next newspaper installment of each novel. Today, when reading
### a novel such as A Tale of Two Cities, only the most hard-hearted
### reader could fail to feel empathy for Sidney Carton as he approaches
### the guillotine. One who empathizes suffers along with the one who
### feels the sensations directly. Empathy is similar to sympathy, but
### empathy usually suggests stronger, more instinctive feeling. So a
### person who feels sympathy, or pity, for victims of a war in Asia may
### feel empathy for a close friend going through the much smaller
### disaster of a divorce.

### telepathic
### Involving apparent communication from
### one mind to another without speech or signs.
### • After ten years of marriage, their communication is virtually
### telepathic, and each always seems to know what the other is
### thinking.
### Since tele- means “distant” (see
### TELE
### ), you can see how telepathy
### means basically “feeling communicated from a distance.” The word
### was coined around 1880, when odd psychic phenomena were being
### widely discussed by people hoping that researchers might find a
### scientific basis for what they believed they themselves were
### experiencing.
### Today,
### when
### people
### talk
### about
### extrasensory
### perception, or ESP, telepathy is usually what they're talking about. In
### recent years, the notion of memes—ideas that might somehow
### physically fly from brain to brain so that people all over the world
### might have the same idea at about the same time without any
### obvious communication—has been widely discussed. Even though
### scientists haven't been able to establish the existence of telepathy,
### about 30% of Americans continue to believe in it.

### PEN/PUN
### comes from the Latin words poena, “penalty,” and punire,
### “to punish.” A penalty is, of course, a punishment.

### penal
### Having to do with punishment or penalties, or
### institutions where punishment is given.
### • The classic novels Les Misérables and The Count of Monte Cristo
### portray the terrible conditions in French penal institutions in the 19th
### century.
### A state or country's penal code defines its crimes and describes its
### punishments. During the 18th and 19th centuries, many countries
### established
### penal
### colonies,
### where
### criminals
### were
### sent
### as
### punishment. Often these were unbearably severe; but it was to such
### colonies that some of Australia's and the United States' early white
### inhabitants came, and the convicts provided labor for the European
### settlement of these lands.

### impunity
### Freedom from punishment, harm, or loss.
### • Under the flag of truce, the soldiers crossed the field with impunity.
### Impunity is protection from punishment, just as immunity is
### protection from disease. Tom Sawyer, in Mark Twain's novel, broke
### his Aunt Polly's rules with near impunity because he could usually
### sweet-talk her into forgiving him; if that failed, he had enjoyed
### himself so much he didn't care what punishment she gave him.

### penance
### An act of self-punishment or religious devotion
### to show sorrow or regret for sin or wrongdoing.
### • In the Middle Ages bands of pilgrims would trudge to distant holy
### sites as penance for their sins.
### Penance as a form of apology for a mistake can be either voluntary
### or ordered by someone else. Many religions include penance among
### the ways in which believers can show repentance or regret for a
### misdeed. The Christian season of Lent, 40 days long, is traditionally
### a time for doing penance.

### punitive
### Giving, involving, or aiming at punishment.
### • The least popular teachers are usually the ones with punitive
### attitudes, those who seem to enjoy punishing more than teaching.
### Punitive is an important word in the law. When you sue a person or
### company for having wronged you in some way, you normally ask for
### something of value equal to what you were deprived of by the other
### party. But when the defendant has done something particularly bad,
### you may also ask for punitive damages, money over and above the
### actual cost of the harm done, intended to teach the defendant a
### lesson. Punitive damages are fairly rare, but when they're actually
### granted they may be as much as four times the size of the basic
### damages.

### MATR/MATER
### comes from the Greek and Latin words for “mother.”
### A matron is a mature woman with children. And matrimony is
### marriage itself, the traditional first step toward motherhood.

### maternity
### The state of being a mother;
### motherhood.
### • It's quite possible that the Mona Lisa is a portrait of maternity, and
### that the painting marks the recent birth of her child Andrea.
### Maternity is used as both a noun and an adjective. Maternity
### benefits are benefits specially provided by employers for women
### having babies, and usually include maternity leave, time off work.
### With maternity come maternal feelings, which are shown by all
### species of warm-blooded animals as well as a few reptiles such as
### crocodiles and alligators.

### matriarch
### A woman who controls a family, group, or
### government.
### • Every August all the grown children and their families are
### summoned to the estate by the matriarch.
### A matriarchy is a social unit governed by a woman or group of
### women. It isn't certain that a true matriarchal society has ever
### existed, so matriarchy is usually treated as an imaginative concept.
### But there are societies in which relatedness through women rather
### than men is stressed, and elements of matriarchy may be stronger in
### certain societies than they are in most of the Western world. And
### most of us can point to families in which a woman has become the
### dominant figure, or grande dame, or matriarch.

### matrilineal
### Based on or tracing the family
### through the mother.
### • Many of the peoples of Ghana in Africa trace their family through
### matrilineal connections.
### A person's lineage is his or her line of ancestors. So matrilineal
### means basically “through the mother's line,” just as patrilineal means
### “through the father's line.” Matrilineality is an important concept in
### anthropology; among other things, it usually determines who will
### inherit property on a person's death. Though families that follow the
### European model take the father's name and are therefore patrilineal,
### matrilineal societies have existed around the world, including among
### various American Indian tribes.

### matrix
### (1) Something (such as a situation or a set of
### conditions) in which something else develops or forms. (2)
### Something shaped like a pattern of lines and spaces.
### • The country's political matrix is so complex that no one who hasn't
### lived there could possibly understand it.
### In ancient Rome, a matrix was a female animal kept for breeding, or
### a plant (sometimes called a “parent plant” or “mother plant”) whose
### seeds were used for producing other plants. In English the word has
### taken on many related meanings. Mathematicians use it for a
### rectangular organization of numbers or symbols that can be used to
### make various calculations; geologists use it for the soil or rock in
### which a fossil is discovered, like a baby in the womb. And matrix was
### a good choice as the name of the reality in which all humans find
### themselves living in a famous series of science-fiction films.

### AQU
### comes from aqua, the Latin word for “water.” We keep pet fish
### in an aquarium at home or visit larger sea animals in a building with
### that name. Water sports such as swimming, canoeing, and sailing
### are sometimes called aquatics. In Scandinavia there's a popular
### drink called aquavit, the name coming from the Latin aqua vitae,
### “water of life”—though instead of water it mostly consists of alcohol.

### aquaculture
### The farming of plants and animals
### (such as kelp, fish, and shellfish) that live in the water.
### • The farming of oysters by the Romans was an early form of
### aquaculture that has continued to the present day.
### For most of the modern history of aquaculture, only costly fish and
### shellfish like salmon and shrimp were harvested. But new
### technologies are allowing cheaper and more efficient cultivation of
### fish for food, and such common fish as cod are now being farmed.
### Seaweeds and other algae are also being grown—for food (mostly in
### Asia), cattle feed, fertilizer, and experimentally as a source of energy.
### Aquaculture is now the world's fastest-growing form of food
### production.

### aquanaut
### A scuba diver who lives and works both
### inside and outside an underwater shelter for an extended time.
### • Each scientist at the laboratory spent two weeks a year as an
### aquanaut living in the deep-sea station.
### Aquanaut combines aqua with the Greek nautes, meaning “sailor.”
### Like astronaut and aeronaut, the word may remind you of those
### mythical Greek heroes known as the Argonauts, who sailed with
### Jason on his ship, the Argo, in quest of the Golden Fleece. Various
### underwater habitats for aquanauts, such as Conshelf, SEALAB, and
### MarineLab, have captured the public imagination since the 1960s.

### aqueduct
### (1) A pipe or channel for water. (2) A
### bridgelike structure for carrying water over a valley.
### • Roman aqueducts were built throughout the empire, and their
### spectacular arches can still be seen in Greece, France, Spain, and
### North Africa.
### Based party on the Latin ducere, meaning “lead” or “conduct” (see
### DUC/DUCT
### ), the word aqueduct named an ancient civil-engineering
### marvel. You may have seen photos of the great arches of ancient
### aqueducts spanning valleys in countries throughout the old Roman
### Empire, practical pipelines that are also regarded as works of
### timeless beauty. From the 20th century, the 242-mile Colorado River
### Aqueduct, the 336-mile Central Arizona Project, and the 444-mile
### California
### Aqueduct
### are
### considered
### wonders
### of
### American
### engineering, but they are not renowned for their beauty. Most
### aqueducts today either are riverlike channels or run underground,
### perhaps appearing simply as a long mound.

### aquifer
### A layer of rock, sand, or gravel that can absorb
### and hold water.
### • Cities without access to a nearby lake or river must rely on
### underground aquifers to meet their water needs.
### The vast but relatively shallow Ogallala Aquifer lies beneath the
### Great Plains, under portions of eight states. Its thickness ranges
### from a few feet to more than a thousand feet. The Ogallala yields
### about 30 percent of the nation's groundwater used for irrigation in

### Answers

## Words from Mythology
### cereal
### (1) A plant that produces grain that can be eaten
### as food, or the grain it produces. (2) The food made from grain.
### • Rice is the main food cereal of Asia, whereas wheat and corn are
### the main food cereals of the West.
### The Roman goddess Ceres, the equivalent of the Greek Demeter,
### was a calm goddess who didn't take part in the quarrels of the other
### gods. Her particular responsibility was the food-giving plants, and for
### that reason the food grains came to carry her name. Cereals of the
### ancient Romans included wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and millet—but
### not corn (maize), which was a cereal of the Americas.

### Junoesque
### Having mature, poised, and dignified
### beauty.
### • In 1876, as a centennial gift, the French sent to America a massive
### statue of a robed Junoesque figure representing Liberty, to be
### erected in New York Harbor.
### Juno was the wife of Jupiter, the chief of the Roman gods. As the
### first among goddesses, her power gave her particular dignity; and as
### goddess of women and marriage, she was a mature matron. But
### such younger goddesses as Diana, goddess of the hunt, perhaps
### came closer to today's ideals of slim and athletic female beauty.

### martial
### Having to do with war and military life.
### • The stirring, martial strains of “The British Grenadiers” echoed
### down the snowy street just as dawn was breaking.
### Mars was the Roman god of war and one of the patron gods of
### Rome itself. He was responsible for everything military, from warriors
### to weapons to marching music. Thus, martial arts are skills of
### combat and self-defense also practiced as sport. When martial law is
### declared, a country's armed forces take over the functions of the
### police. And a court-martial is a military court or trial.

### Promethean
### New or creative in a daring way.
### • Beginning in the 1950s, the little Asian countries of South Korea,
### Taiwan, and Singapore began to display a Promethean energy that
### would become one of the marvels of the modern world.
### Prometheus was a Titan, a generation older than Zeus. When Zeus
### overthrew his own father Cronus and seized power, Prometheus
### fought on the side of the gods and against his fellow Titans. But
### when Zeus later wanted to destroy the race of humans, Prometheus
### saved them by stealing fire for them from the gods. He also taught
### them how to write, farm, build houses, read the stars and weather,
### cure themselves when sick, and tame animals—in short, all the arts
### and skills that make humans unique. So inventive was he that
### anything of great creativity and originality can still be called
### Promethean. But Prometheus had taken a terrible risk; enraged by
### his disobedience, Zeus had him chained to a rocky cliff, where for
### many long centuries an eagle daily tore at his liver.

### Sisyphean
### Endless and difficult, involving many
### disappointments.
### • After twenty years, many researchers had begun to think that
### defeating the virus was a Sisyphean task that would never succeed.
### Reputedly the cleverest man on earth, King Sisyphus of Corinth
### tricked the gods into bringing him back to life after he had died. For
### this they punished him by sending him back to the underworld,
### where he must eternally roll a huge rock up a long, steep hill, only to
### watch it roll back to where he started. Something Sisyphean
### demands the same kind of unending, thankless, and ultimately
### unsuccessful efforts.

### titanic
### Having great size, strength, or power; colossal.
### • The titanic floods of 1993 destroyed whole towns on the
### Mississippi River.
### In Greek mythology, the Titans were the generation of giant creators
### that produced the younger, stronger, cleverer gods, who soon
### overpowered and replaced them (see Promethean above). In 1911
### the largest ship that had ever been built was christened the Titanic
### for its unmatched size and strength. But the name may have proved
### unlucky; on its maiden voyage in 1912 a massive iceberg ripped a
### fatal hole in the great ship, and it sank in the icy waters off
### Newfoundland.

### Triton
### (1) A being with a human upper body and the lower
### body of a fish; a merman. (2) Any of various large mollusks with a
### heavy, conical shell.
### • In one corner of the painting, a robust Triton emerges from the
### sea with his conch to announce the coming of the radiant queen.
### Triton was originally the son of the sea god Poseidon (or Neptune).
### A guardian of the fish and other creatures of the sea, he is usually
### shown as hearty, muscular, and cheerful. Like his father, he often
### carries a trident (three-pronged fork) and may ride in a chariot
### drawn by seahorses. Blowing on his conch shell, he creates the roar
### of the ocean. As a decorative image, Tritons are simply the male
### version of mermaids. The handsome seashells that bear their name
### are the very conchs on which they blow. Triton has also given his
### name to the planet Neptune's largest moon.

### vulcanize
### To treat crude or synthetic rubber or plastic
### so that it becomes elastic and strong and resists decay.
### • The native islanders had even discovered how to vulcanize the
### rubber from the local trees in a primitive way.
### The Roman god Vulcan (the Greek Hephaestus) was in charge of fire
### and the skills that use fire, especially blacksmithing. When Charles
### Goodyear almost accidentally discovered how to vulcanize rubber in
### 1839, he revolutionized the rubber industry. He called his process
### vulcanization because it used fire to heat a mix of rubber and sulfur.
### Vulcanized rubber was soon being used for shoes and other
### products, and in the Civil War balloons made of this new, stronger
### rubber carried Union spies over the Confederate armies. The
### material's importance increased greatly over the years, and today
### vulcanized rubber remains in use for automobile tires and numerous
### other products.
