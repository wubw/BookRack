### MUR
### , from the Latin noun murus, meaning “wall,” has produced a
### modest number of English words.

### muralist
### A painter of wall paintings.
### • She's enjoying her new career as a muralist, but it's terribly hard
### on her when she sees her works wrecked by vandals.
### Any wall painting may be called a mural. Murals have been around
### since long before the framed painting. Scenic murals date back to at
### least 2000 B.C. on the island of Crete. Indoor murals for private
### homes were popular in ancient Greece and Rome, and many of
### those at Pompeii were preserved by the lava of Mt. Vesuvius. In the
### Renaissance the muralists Raphael and Michelangelo created great
### wall and ceiling paintings for the Catholic Church, and Leonardo da
### Vinci's The Last Supper became one of the most famous of all
### murals. Mural painting saw a great revival in Mexico beginning in the
### 1920s, when a group of muralists inspired by the Mexican
### Revolution, including Diego Rivera, J. C. Orozco, and D. A. Siqueiros,
### began taking their intensely political art to the public by creating
### giant wall paintings, sometimes on outdoor surfaces.

### intramural
### Existing or occurring within the bounds
### of an institution, especially a school.
### • At college he lacked the time to go out for sports in a serious way,
### but he did play intramural hockey all four years.
### With its Latin prefix intra-, “within” (not to be confused with inter-,
### “between”), intramural means literally “within the walls.” The word is
### usually used for sports played between teams made up only from
### students at one campus. Intramural athletics is often the most
### popular extracurricular activity at a college or university.

### extramural
### Existing outside or beyond the walls
### or boundaries of an organized unit such as a school or hospital.
### • “Hospital Without Walls” is an extramural program that offers
### home health-care services.
### Extramural contains the Latin extra-, meaning “outside” or “beyond”
### (see
### EXTRA
### ). The walls in extramural are usually those of schools,
### colleges, and universities, and the word is often seen in phrases like
### “extramural activities” and “extramural competition,” referring to
### things that involve the world beyond the campus. Some institutions
### use the term “extramural study” for what others call “distance
### learning”—that is, teaching and learning by means of Web
### connections to the classroom and to videos of lectures. Money that
### flows into universities to support research (from foundations,
### government institutes, etc.) is usually called “extramural income.”

### immure
### To enclose within, or as if within, walls; imprison.
### • In Dumas's famous novel, the Count of Monte Cristo is in fact a
### sailor who had been unjustly immured in an island prison for 15
### years before breaking out and taking his revenge.
### In Eastern European legend, whenever a large bridge or fort was
### completed, a young maiden would be immured in the stonework as
### a sacrifice. (It's not certain that such things were actually done.) In
### Poe's grim story “A Cask of Amontillado,” a man achieves revenge on
### a fellow nobleman by chaining him to a cellar wall and bricking him
### up alive. At the end of Verdi's great opera Aida, Aida joins her lover
### so that they can die immured together. But real-life examples of
### immurement as a final punishment are somewhat harder to find.

### POLIS/POLIT
### comes from the Greek word for “city.” The ancient
### Greek city-states, such as Athens, Thebes, and Sparta, operated
### much like separate nations, so all their politics was local, like all their
### public policy—and even all their police!

### politic
### (1) Cleverly tactful. (2) Wise in promoting a plan
### or plan of action.
### • Anger is rarely a politic way to seek agreement, since it usually
### comes across as rude and self-righteous.
### Politic behavior in class always requires a respectful attitude toward
### your teacher. It's never politic to ask for a raise when your boss is in
### a terrible mood. And once teenagers learn to drive, they quickly
### learn the politic way to ask for the car—that is, whatever gets the
### keys without upsetting the parents. As you can see, politic can be
### used for many situations that have nothing to do with public politics.

### politicize
### To give a political tone or character to.
### • By 1968 the Vietnam War had deeply politicized most of America's
### college campuses.
### Sexual harassment was once seen as a private matter, but in the
### 1980s and '90s it became thoroughly politicized, with women loudly
### pressuring lawmakers to make it illegal. So, at the same time, the
### issue of sexual harassment politicized many women, who began to
### take an interest in political action because of it. In other words, we
### may speak of an issue becoming politicized, but also of a person or
### group becoming politicized.

### acropolis
### The high, fortified part of a city, especially
### an ancient Greek city.
### • On the Athenian Acropolis, high above the rest of the city, stands
### the Parthenon, a temple to Athena.
### The Greek root acro- means “high”; thus, an acropolis is basically a
### “high city.” Ancient cities often grew up around a high point, in order
### that they could easily be defended. The Greeks and Romans usually
### included in their acropolises temples to the city's most important
### gods; so, for example, Athens built a great temple on its Acropolis to
### its protector goddess, Athena, from which the city took its name.
### Many later European cities cluster around a walled castle on a
### height, into which the population of the city and the surrounding
### area could retreat in case of attack, and even South American cities
### often contain a similar walled area on high ground.

### megalopolis
### (1) A very large city. (2) A thickly
### populated area that includes one or more cities with the surrounding
### suburbs.
### • With its rapid development, the southern coast of Florida around
### Miami quickly became a megalopolis.
### A “large city” named Megalopolis was founded in Greece in 371 B.C.
### to help defend the region called Arcadia against the city-state of
### Sparta. Though a stadium seating 20,000 was built there, indicating
### the city's impressive size for its time, Megalopolis today has only
### about 5,000 people. Social scientists now identify 10 megalopolises
### in the U.S., each with more than 10 million people. The one on the
### eastern seaboard that stretches from Boston to Washington, D.C.,
### where the densely populated cities seem to flow into each other all
### along the coast, is now home to over 50 million people. But it's
### easily surpassed by the Japanese megalopolis that includes Tokyo,
### with more than 80 million inhabitants.

### NUMER
### comes from the Latin words meaning “number” and “to
### count.” A numeral is the symbol that represents a number. Numerous
### means “many,” and innumerable means “countless.” Numerical
### superiority is superiority in numbers, and your numerical standing in
### a class is a ranking expressed as a number.

### numerology
### The study of the occult significance
### of numbers.
### • Though he didn't believe in numerology as a mystical bond
### between numbers and living things, he never went out on Friday the
### 13th.
### As an element of astrology and fortune-telling, numerology has long
### been employed to predict future events. For many early Christians, 3
### represented the Trinity, 6 represented earthly perfection, and 7
### represented heavenly perfection; and still today, many of us like to
### group things into sets of 3 or 7, for no particular reason. Numerology
### has also been used to interpret personality; in particular,
### numerologists may assign numbers to each letter of a person's name
### and use the resulting figures, along with the person's date of birth,
### as a guide to his or her character.

### alphanumeric
### Having or using both letters and
### numbers.
### • Back in the 1950s, we always spoke our phone numbers in
### alphanumeric form, using the letters printed on the dial: for
### example, “TErrace 5-6642,” instead of “835-6642.”
### Alphanumeric passwords are much harder for a hacker to crack than
### plain alphabetic passwords, since the number of possible
### combinations is so much greater. License plates usually contain both
### letters and numbers, since, for a big state or country, the plate
### wouldn't be large enough to fit enough numbers for everyone. In
### computing, the standard alphanumeric codes, such as ASCII, may
### contain not only ordinary letters and numerals but also punctuation
### marks and math symbols.

### enumerate
### To specify one after another; list.
### • The thing he hated most was when she would start enumerating
### his faults out loud, while he would sit scowling into the newspaper
### trying to ignore her.
### In a census year, the U.S. government attempts to enumerate every
### single citizen of the country—a task that, even in the modern era of
### technology, isn't truly possible. Medical tests often require the
### enumeration of bacteria, viruses, or other organisms to determine
### the progress of a disease or the effectiveness of a medication.
### Despite its numer- root, you don't have to use numbers when
### enumerating. For students of government and law, the “enumerated
### powers” are the specific responsibilities of the Congress, as listed in
### the U.S. Constitution; these are the only powers that Congress has,
### a fact that the Tenth Amendment makes even more clearly.

### supernumerary
### Exceeding the usual
### number.
### • Whenever the workload for the city's courts and judges gets too
### large, supernumerary judges are called in to help.
### Supernumerary starts off with the Latin prefix super-, “above” (see
### SUPER
### ). You may have heard of someone being born with
### supernumerary teeth, supernumerary fingers, or supernumerary
### toes. A supernumerary rainbow may show up as a faint line—red,
### green, or purple—just touching the main colored arc. Supernumerary
### is also a noun: A supernumerary is usually someone in a crowd
### scene onstage, otherwise known as an “extra” or a “spear-carrier.”

### KILO
### is the French version of the Greek word chilioi, meaning
### “thousand.” France is also where the metric system originated, in the
### years following the French Revolution. So in English, kilo- shows up
### chiefly in metric-system units. Before the computer age, the most
### familiar kilo- words for English-speakers were probably kilowatt,
### meaning “1,000 watts,” and kilowatt-hour, meaning the amount of
### energy equal to one kilowatt over the course of an hour.

### kilobyte
### A unit of computer information equal to 1,024
### bytes.
### • A 200-word paragraph in the simplest text format takes up about a
### kilobyte of storage space on your hard drive.
### Knowing the root kilo-, you might think a kilobyte would be exactly
### 1,000 bytes. But actually a kilobyte represents the power of 2 that
### comes closest to 1,000: that is, 2
10
### (2 to the 10th power), or 2 × 2
### × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2, or 1,024. Why 2? Because the
### capacity of memory chips is always based on powers of 2. Locations
### in electronic memory circuits are identified by binary numbers
### (numbers that use only the digits 0 and 1), so the number of
### addressable locations becomes a power of 2.

### kilometer
### A unit of length equal to 1,000 meters.
### • U.S. highway signs near the Canadian border often show distances
### in kilometers in addition to miles.
### A kilometer is equal to about 62/100 of a mile, and a mile is equal to
### about 1.61 kilometers. The U.S. has been slow to adopt metric
### measures, which are used almost everywhere else in the world.
### Though our car speedometers are often marked in both miles and
### kilometers, the U.S. and Great Britain are practically the only
### developed nations that still show miles rather than kilometers on
### their road signs. But even in the U.S., footraces are usually
### measured in meters or kilometers, like the Olympic races. Runners
### normally abbreviate kilometer to K: “a 5K race” (3.1 miles), “the 10K
### run” (6.2 miles), and so on.

### kilohertz
### A unit of frequency equal to 1,000 cycles
### per second.
### • A drone aircraft nosedived and crashed after an onboard tape
### recorder turned out to be using a 10-kilohertz signal, the same
### frequency used by the aircraft's control system.
### If your favorite AM radio station has a frequency of 680 kilohertz
### (kHz), that means the station's transmitter is oscillating (vibrating) at
### a rate of 680,000 cycles per second (i.e., 680,000 times a second). A
### related term is megahertz (MHz), meaning “millions of cycles per
### second.” Shortwave radio operates between 5.9 and 26.1 MHz, and
### the FM radio band operates between 88 and 108 MHz. Garage-door
### openers work at about 40 MHz, baby monitors work at 49 MHz, and
### so on. The terms hertz, kilohertz and megahertz honor the great
### German physicist Heinrich Hertz, the first person to broadcast and
### receive radio waves.

### kilogram
### A unit of weight equal to 1,000 grams.
### • The kilogram is the only base unit of measurement still defined by
### a physical object rather than a physical constant (such as the speed
### of light).
### The original concept of the kilogram, as the mass of a cubic
### decimeter of water (a bit more than a quart), was adopted as the
### base unit of mass by the new revolutionary government of France in
### 1793. In 1875, in the Treaty of the Meter, 17 countries, including the
### U.S., adopted the French kilogram as an international standard. In
### 1889 a new international standard for the kilogram, a metal bar
### made of platinum iridium, was agreed to; President Benjamin
### Harrison officially received the 1-kilogram cylinder for the U.S. in
### 1890. But no one uses that bar very often; for all practical purposes,
### a kilogram equals 2.2 pounds.

### MICRO
### , from the Greek mikros, meaning “small,” is a popular
### English prefix. A microscope lets the eye see microscopic objects,
### and libraries store the pages of old newspapers on microfilm at
### 1/400th of their original size. And we continue to attach micro- to
### lots of familiar words; most of us could figure out the meaning of
### microbus and microquake without ever having heard them before.
### Scientists often use micro- to mean “millionth”; thus, a microsecond
### is a millionth of a second, and a micrometer is a millionth of a meter.

### microbe
### An organism (such as a bacterium) of
### microscopic or less than microscopic size.
### • Vaccines reduce the risk of diseases by using dead or greatly
### weakened microbes to stimulate the immune system.
### A hint of the Greek word bios, meaning “life,” can be seen in
### microbe. Microbes, or microorganisms, include bacteria, protozoa,
### fungi, algae, amoebas, and slime molds. Many people think of
### microbes as simply the causes of disease, but every human is
### actually the host to billions of microbes, and most of them are
### essential to our life. Much research is now going into possible
### microbial sources of future energy; algae looks particularly
### promising, as do certain newly discovered or created microbes that
### can produce cellulose, to be turned into ethanol and other biofuels.

### microbiologist
### A scientist who studies
### extremely small forms of life, such as bacteria and viruses.
### • Food microbiologists study the tiny organisms that cause spoiling
### and foodborne illness.
### Since microorganisms are involved in almost every aspect of life on
### earth, microbiologists work across a broad range of subject areas.
### Some study only viruses, some only bacteria. A marine
### microbiologist studies the roles of microbial communities in the sea.
### A soil microbiologist might focus on the use and spread of nitrogen.
### Veterinary microbiologists might research bacteria that attack
### racehorses or diagnose anthrax in cows. And the government puts
### microbiologists to work studying whether microbes could adapt to
### life on the surface of Mars, and how to defend ourselves against the
### possibility of germ warfare.

### microbrew
### A beer made by a brewery that makes
### beer in small amounts.
### • As a city of 75,000 people with eight breweries, it offers a greater
### variety of microbrews per capita than any other place in America.
### Microbrews are usually beers or ales made with special malts and
### hops, unfiltered and unpasteurized, and thus distinctive in their
### aroma and flavor. Many microbreweries double as bar/restaurants,
### called brewpubs, where the gleaming vats may be visible behind a
### glass partition. “Craft brewing” and the opening of local brewpubs
### began in earnest in the U.S. in the 1980s. But not everyone is willing
### to pay extra for a beer, and lots of people are simply used to the
### blander taste of the best-selling beers, so by 2008 microbrews still
### only accounted for about 4% of all beer sold in the U.S.

### microclimate
### The essentially uniform local
### climate of a small site or habitat.
### • Temperature, light, wind speed, and moisture are the essential
### components of a microclimate.
### The microclimate of an industrial park may be quite different from
### that of a nearby wooded park, since the plants absorb light and heat
### while asphalt parking lots and rooftops radiate them back into the
### air. A microclimate can offer a small growing area for crops that
### wouldn't do well in the wider region, so skilled gardeners take
### advantage of microclimates by carefully choosing and positioning
### their plants. San Francisco's hills, oceanfront, and bay shore, along
### with its alternating areas of concrete and greenery, make it a city of
### microclimates.

### MULTI
### comes from the Latin word multus, meaning “many.” Thus, a
### multicultural society is one that includes people of several different
### countries, languages, and religions; a multimedia artwork uses two
### or more artistic media (dance, music, film, spoken text, etc.); and a
### multitude of complaints reaching your office would be a great many
### indeed.

### multicellular
### Consisting of many cells.
### •
### Multicellular
### organisms—fungi,
### plants,
### and
### animals—have
### specialized cells that perform different functions.
### Multicellular organisms are distinguished from the very primitive
### single-celled organisms—bacteria, algae, amoebas, etc. Even
### sponges, simple as they are, have specialized cell types such as
### digestive cells. In complex multicellular organisms, only the surface
### cells can exchange substances with the external environment, so the
### organisms have developed transport systems such as the circulatory
### system, in which the blood brings gases and nutrients to the cells
### and removes waste products from them.

### multidisciplinary
### Involving two or more
### subject areas.
### • Her favorite class was Opera, a multidisciplinary class taught jointly
### by a music professor and a literature professor.
### A discipline is a field of study. So a multidisciplinary (or
### interdisciplinary) course is a team-taught course in which students
### are asked to understand a single subject as it's seen by two or more
### traditional disciplines. Multidisciplinary teaching can open students'
### eyes to different views of a subject that they had never considered
### before. A multidisciplinary panel discussion, on the other hand,
### presents views from scholars in different fields but may leave any
### merging of the information to the audience.

### multifarious
### Having or occurring in great
### variety; diverse.
### • Natives put the coconut palm to multifarious uses: using the nuts
### for eating, the juice for drinking, the wood for building huts, the
### leaves for thatch, the fiber for mats, and the shells for utensils.
### Multifarious is a rather grand word, probably not for everyday use,
### but when you want to emphasize great variety—such as the huge
### number of uses to which a state-of-the-art cell phone can be put—it
### can be effective. Dictionary fans are constantly amazed by the
### multifarious meanings of the word set (47 of them in one
### unabridged dictionary), and thesaurus lovers may marvel at the
### multifarious synonyms for drunk.

### multilateral
### Involving more than two nations or
### parties.
### • A couple of times a year, representatives of the large industrial
### democracies meet for a round of multilateral trade negotiations.
### Since lateral means “side” (see
### LATER
### ), multilateral means basically
### “many-sided.” The philosophy of multilateralism claims that the best
### solutions generally result when as many of the world's nations as
### possible are involved in discussions, and multilateralists often favor
### strengthening the United Nations. Today multilateralism can be seen
### at work in, for example, the World Health Organization, the World
### Trade Organization, and the International Criminal Court. But the
### U.S. doesn't always join the major multilateral organizations, instead
### often behaving as if a unilateral approach—that is, going it alone—
### was best for the interests of a powerful nation.

### Answers

### PAR
### , from the Latin, means “equal.” Our English word par means an
### amount taken as an average or a standard, and especially the
### standard score for each hole on a golf course—which is why the
### phrase “par for the course” means “about as well as expected.” We
### compare things to see if they're equal; similar things can be called
### comparable—that is, “equal with.” And “on a par with” means
### “comparable to.”

### parity
### The state of being equal.
### • That year the Canadian dollar reached parity with the U.S. dollar
### for the first time in three decades.
### Parity has special meanings in such fields as physics, math,
### medicine, genetics, and marketing. Back when the Soviet Union and
### the U.S. were opposing superpowers, there was often talk of parity
### in nuclear weapons between the two sides. We sometimes hear
### about parity between mental and physical health in insurance
### coverage, or parity in colleges' funding of men's and women's
### athletics. But parity may be most common in discussions of
### currencies. The exchange rate between two national currencies often
### changes every day, as each drifts higher or lower, and occasionally
### two similar currencies, such as the euro and the U.S. dollar, will
### achieve parity, but it rarely lasts long.

### disparity
### A noticeable and often unfair difference
### between people or things.
### • He'd been noticing an increasing disparity between what the
### government was claiming and what he saw happening all around
### him.
### Disparity contains the Latin dis, meaning “apart” or “non-” (see
### DIS
### ),
### so a disparity is a kind of “nonequality.” The word is often used to
### describe a social or economic condition that's considered unfairly
### unequal: a racial disparity in hiring, a health disparity between the
### rich and the poor, an income disparity between men and women,
### and so on. Its adjective, disparate (accented on the first syllable), is
### often used to emphasize strong differences.

### nonpareil
### Someone or something of unequaled
### excellence.
### • Critics seem to agree that this is the new nonpareil of video-game
### consoles, the one to beat.
### American children learn this word (even if they can't pronounce it)
### as the name of the candies covered with white sugar pellets that
### they buy at the movie theater, and it's also the name of the pellets
### themselves. But the more general meaning is common too.
### Nonpareil is also an adjective. A famous boxing champion of the
### 1920s was known as Nonpareil Jack Dempsey, when he wasn't being
### called “the Manassa Mauler.” Like its synonyms paragon and
### peerless, nonpareil is popular as a company and product name; it's
### also the name of a fruit, an almond, a bird, and a butterfly.

### subpar
### Below a usual or normal level.
### • Because of a severe cold, her performance that evening had been
### subpar, but the audience seemed to love it anyway.
### Since sub- means “below” (see
### SUB
### ), almost anything that fails to
### measure up to a traditional standard may be called subpar. So you
### may hear of subpar ratings for a TV show, subpar care at a nursing
### home, subpar attendance at a concert, or subpar work by a
### contractor. If you played a subpar round of golf, though, you needed
### more strokes than you should have.

### PHOB
### comes from the Greek noun phobos, “fear,” and it shows up
### clearly in our noun phobia, meaning “unusual fear of a specific
### thing.” Phobias vary greatly in seriousness and also in frequency.
### Most of us have experienced claustrophobia at some time, but few
### truly suffer from fear of the number 13, a condition known as
### triskaidekaphobia.

### acrophobic
### Fearful of heights.
### • She's so acrophobic that, whenever she can't avoid taking the
### route that includes the high bridge, she asks the police to drive her
### across.
### The Greek akron means “height” or “summit,” and the acro- root can
### be seen in such words as acrobat and Acropolis. Almost everyone
### has some fear of heights, but an abnormal dread of high places,
### along with the vertigo (dizziness) that most acrophobes also
### experience, are common as well; in fact, acrophobia is one of the
### half-dozen most common recognized phobias. Acrophobia and
### claustrophobia both play a role in another well-known phobia: the
### fear of flying, itself often known as aerophobia.

### agoraphobia
### A fear of being in embarrassing or
### inescapable situations, especially in open or public places.
### • After barely surviving a terrible attack of agoraphobia in the middle
### of the Sonoran Desert, he finally agree to start seeing a
### psychologist.
### The agora was the marketplace in ancient Greece; thus, agoraphobia
### often involves fear of public places and crowds. But it also may
### involve fear of being in shops, or even fear of being in open spaces,
### or fear of traveling alone. It may also be a fear of experiencing some
### uncontrollable or embarrassing event (like fainting) in the presence
### of others with no help available. Agoraphobia can be hard to
### understand for those who don't suffer from it, especially because it
### can take so many different forms, but it is often a serious and
### socially crippling condition.

### xenophobe
### One who has a fear or hatred of strangers
### or foreigners.
### • A Middle Easterner reading the U.S.'s visa restrictions might feel
### that the State Department was run by xenophobes.
### Xenophobe is partly based on the Greek noun xenos, meaning
### “stranger, guest, foreigner.” Unlike other phobias, xenophobia isn't
### really considered an abnormal condition; instead, it's generally
### thought of as just serious narrow-mindedness, the kind of thinking
### that goes along with racism and extreme patriotism. In times of war,
### a government will often actually try to turn all its citizens into
### xenophobes.

### arachnophobia
### Having a fear or dislike of
### spiders.
### • At 50, my sister still suffers from arachnophobia, and can't sleep in
### a room unless she knows it has no spiders.
### In Greek mythology, Arachne was a weaver of such skill that she
### dared to challenge the goddess Athena at her craft. When she won
### their competition by weaving a tapestry disrespectful to the gods,
### the enraged Athena tore it to shreds, and in despair Arachne hanged
### herself. Out of pity, Athena loosened the rope, which became a
### cobweb, and changed Arachne into a spider. Today, the spiders,
### scorpions, mites, and ticks all belong to the class known as
### arachnids. Arachnophobia is the most common of the animal
### phobias; but many people suffer from similar phobias regarding
### snakes (ophidiophobia), dogs (cynophobia), and mice and rats
### (musophobia).

## Medical Words
### HEM/HEMO
### comes from the Greek word for “blood” and is found at
### the beginning of many medical terms. By dropping the h-, the same
### word produced the suffix -emia, which likewise shows up in lots of
### “blood” words, including anemia, leukemia and hyperglycemia.

### hemorrhage
### (1) A large loss of blood from a blood
### vessel. (2) A rapid and uncontrollable loss or outflow.
### • He arrived at the emergency room reporting headache, nausea,
### and drowsiness, and the doctor immediately suspected that he'd
### suffered a brain hemorrhage.
### A hemorrhage usually results from either a severe blow to the body
### or from medication being taken for something else. Though many
### hemorrhages aren't particularly serious, those that occur in the brain
### (cerebral hemorrhages) can be life-threatening. In older people,
### hemorrhages are often caused by blood-thinning medication taken
### to prevent heart attacks. A bruise (or hematoma) is a hemorrhage
### close enough to the surface of the skin to be visible. Hemorrhage is
### also a verb, which isn't always used to talk about actual blood; thus,
### we may hear that a business is hemorrhaging money, or that the
### U.S. has been hemorrhaging industrial jobs for decades. Be careful
### when writing hemorrhage; it's not an easy word to spell.

### hematology
### The study of blood and blood-
### forming organs.
### • Her specialty in hematology let her work with patients of all ages
### and types, since blood problems may affect almost anyone.
### Blood is basic to almost all the body's functions, and a blood test can
### reveal more about your physical condition than almost any other
### kind of examination, so hematology is an important medical
### specialty, with many separate subjects. Since blood cells are formed
### in the bone marrow, the bones are one important focus for
### hematologists. The coagulation, or thickening, of the blood is
### another important subject, since coagulation is what keeps us from
### bleeding to death from even small wounds. And there are dozens of
### serious blood diseases, including anemia (a lack of red blood cells)
### and leukemia (cancer involving a buildup of white blood cells).

### hemophilia
### A bleeding disorder caused by the
### blood's inability to coagulate.
### • When he was a child, his hemophilia had kept him from joining the
### other kids in rough play at recess.
### The dreaded disease known as hemophilia is the result of an
### inherited gene, and almost always strikes boys rather than girls
### (though mothers may pass the gene to their sons). Since the blood
### lacks an ingredient that causes it to clot or coagulate when a blood
### vessel breaks, even a minor wound can cause a hemophiliac to bleed
### to death if not treated. Bleeding can be particularly dangerous when
### it's entirely internal, with no visible wound, since the person may not
### be aware it's happening. Queen Victoria transmitted the hemophilia
### gene to royal families all across Europe; the hemophilia of a young
### Russian prince played a part in the downfall of the Russian czars.
### Today, hemophiliacs take drugs that stop the bleeding by speeding
### coagulation, and hemophiliac life expectancies in developed
### countries are almost as long as the average.

### hemoglobin
### The element in blood that
### transports oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and
### transports carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs.
### • Her doctor had noticed her low hemoglobin count and was
### insisting that she include more iron-rich vegetables in her diet.
### When filled with oxygen, the hemoglobin in your blood is bright red;
### returning to the lungs without its oxygen, it loses its brightness and
### becomes somewhat bluish. Hemoglobin levels can change from day
### to day, and may be affected by such factors as a lack of iron in the
### diet, a recent loss of blood, and being pregnant. When you give
### blood, a nurse first pricks your finger to test your hemoglobin level;
### a low hemoglobin count indicates anemia and may mean that you
### shouldn't give blood that day. Mild anemia is generally of little
### importance, but some types can be very serious.

### ITIS
### , a suffix found in both Greek and Latin, means “disease” or
### “inflammation.” In appendicitis your appendix is swollen and painful,
### and in tonsillitis the same is true of your tonsils. With laryngitis, your
### throat and larynx may become so sore that it's difficult to talk. Some
### of us enjoy making up our own -itis words; high-school teachers, for
### example, long ago noticed that many of their seniors tended to lose
### all interest in schoolwork and start skipping classes, and labeled the
### condition senioritis.

### bursitis
### Inflammation of a lubricating sac (bursa),
### especially of the shoulder or elbow.
### • My barber developed bursitis after many years of lifting his arms all
### day.
### A bursa is a little pouch filled with fluid that sits between a tendon
### and a bone. When the fluid becomes infected by bacteria or irritated
### by too much movement, bursitis results. Throwing a baseball too
### many times at one session, for example, may inflame and irritate
### one of the bursae (notice the plural form) in the shoulder. Bursitis in
### another part of the body may be known by a traditional name such
### as “housemaid's knee,” “soldier's heel,” or “tennis elbow.” Bursitis
### generally goes away after a few weeks of resting the affected area,
### and the pain can be treated with ice packs and aspirin.

### hepatitis
### Inflammation of the liver.
### • His skin now had a yellowish tinge, as did the whites of his eyes,
### and his doctor immediately recognized the signs of advanced
### hepatitis.
### The liver, the body's largest gland, performs many important tasks,
### but is also vulnerable to many illnesses. At least five types of
### hepatitis, labeled with the letters A–E, are caused by viruses. The
### most common are hepatitis A, acquired through contaminated food
### and water; hepatitis B, which usually travels via sexual activity or
### shared needles; and hepatitis C, generally passed through shared
### needles. Some other types, including alcoholic hepatitis (caused by
### drinking too much alcohol), aren't infectious. There are vaccines for
### types A and B, and drug treatments for A, B, and C, though the
### drugs aren't always effective.

### bronchitis
### Inflammation of the bronchial tubes.
### • Before the smoking ban went into effect, three flight attendants
### had sued the airline, claiming secondhand smoke was to blame for
### their bronchitis.
### The bronchial tubes carry air into the tiny branches and smaller cells
### of the lungs. In bronchitis, the tubes become sore and you develop a
### deep cough. Bronchitis caused by bacteria can be treated with
### antibiotics, but there's no drug treatment for the more common kind
### caused by a virus. A bout of bronchitis may involve a couple of
### weeks of coughing (with no laughing allowed), weakness, and loss
### of energy and interest in doing things. Apart from that, bronchitis is
### rarely serious—at least if it doesn't progress to pneumonia.

### tendinitis
### A painful condition in which a tendon in
### the arm or leg becomes inflamed.
### • After years of tennis and bicycling, she now has tendinitis of both
### the elbow and the knee.
### Tendinitis is often seen in active, healthy people who do something
### that requires repeated motion, including golfers and tennis players
### (especially those with improper form), carpenters, and violinists. It's
### usually treated by keeping the joint from moving, by means of a
### splint, cast, or bandage. If not dealt with in time, tendinitis can turn
### into the more serious tendinosis, or tendon degeneration.
