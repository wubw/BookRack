### NECRO
### comes from the Greek nekros, meaning “dead body,” so it's
### not surprising that it shows up in some unappetizing places. A
### necrophagous insect, for instance, is one that feeds on dead bodies;
### when homicide investigators discover a corpse, they may use the
### insect evidence to figure out when the person died.

### necrosis
### Death of living tissue, usually within a
### limited area.
### • He had ignored the spider bite for several days, and his doctor was
### alarmed to see that serious necrosis had set in.
### Cells die naturally after a period of time, but may also die as a result
### of injuries, infections, or cancer. Burns produce necrosis, and the
### bedsores suffered by nursing-home patients are a form of necrosis.
### The dreaded condition known as gangrene, in which the dying tissue
### turns black or green, is another form. When untreated, the dying
### cells release substances that lead to the death of surrounding cells,
### so untreated necrosis can lead to death. Treatment usually requires
### the removal of the necrotic tissue, and in severe cases can even
### involve amputating a limb.

### necromancer
### One who conjures the spirits of
### the dead in order to magically reveal the future or influence the
### course of events.
### • Her specialty is communication with the dead, and she might once
### have been known as a necromancer, but her sign says simply
### “Psychic.”
### The practice of necromancy goes back as far as the ancient
### Assyrians and Babylonians and has continued through all the
### centuries since. In the Middle Ages it became associated with black
### magic; condemned by the church, it had to be practiced secretly. In
### Europe a necromancer might work in a remote graveyard at night,
### standing within a magical circle he had drawn to shield himself from
### the anger of the spirits. The grave of a person who had died
### suddenly or violently might be plundered for its body parts; the
### unused energy these were believed to contain made them valuable
### in the necromantic ceremony. But body parts aren't essential to
### necromancy, which is now practiced by channelers, mediums, and
### shamans, and even by groups of amateurs sitting around a Ouija
### board.

### necropolis
### A cemetery, especially a large,
### elaborate cemetery of an ancient city.
### • On Sundays the downtown is like a necropolis, and he was always
### slightly disturbed by the complete absence of life among all those
### buildings.
### With its -polis ending, meaning “city” (see
### POLIS/POLIT
### ), a
### necropolis is a “city of the dead.” Most of the famous necropolises of
### Egypt line the Nile River across from their cities. In ancient Greece
### and Rome, a necropolis would often line the road leading out of a
### city; in the 1940s a great Roman necropolis was discovered under
### the Vatican's St. Peter's Basilica. Some more recent cemeteries
### especially deserve the name necropolis because they resemble cities
### of aboveground tombs, a necessity in low-lying areas such as New
### Orleans where a high water table prevents underground burial.

### necropsy
### An autopsy, especially one performed on
### an animal.
### • Daisy's sudden death was so mysterious that we paid for a
### necropsy, and it turned out she'd been a victim of lethal chemicals in
### our imported dog food.
### Human autopsies are generally performed either to determine the
### cause of death or to observe the deadly effects of a disease for
### research or education purposes. Autopsies may be necessary when
### tracking an epidemic; they're also performed to discover whether a
### death might actually have resulted from murder, and if so, what
### evidence it might reveal that could help catch the murderer. Animal
### necropsies are actually more common than human autopsies, since a
### farmer with livestock is always concerned that whatever killed one
### animal not pose a threat to the others.

### PALEO
### comes from the Greek palaios, meaning “ancient”—that is,
### “older than old.” The prefix sometimes gets attached to very
### recognizable words; paleobiology, for instance, deals with the
### biology of fossil organisms, paleogeography is the study of
### geography in earlier geological eras, and paleoecology is the study
### of the relationship of plants and animals to their environment in
### those eras.

### Paleolithic
### Of or relating to the earliest period of
### the Stone Age, characterized by rough or chipped stone implements.
### • He raves about the health benefits of his Paleolithic diet, the kind
### that our pre-agricultural, hunting-and-gathering Stone Age ancestors
### would have eaten.
### Since lithos means “stone” in Greek, the name Paleolithic was given
### to the older part of the Stone Age. The first known period of human
### culture, the Paleolithic actually covers almost all of human history,
### from the first use of stone tools around 2.5 million years ago until
### the invention of agriculture around 10,000 years ago. For almost all
### that time, humans used the very crudest of stone tools, produced by
### chipping away flakes of stone in order to make an edge for an ax or
### knife. Near the end of the period, animal bones and antlers were
### being used for tools, especially pointed tools, and sculpted figures
### and cave art were being produced. The Paleolithic gave way to the
### Mesolithic (“Middle Stone Age”) period, with its tools made of
### polished stone, wood, and bone.

### paleography
### (1) The study of ancient writings
### and inscriptions. (2) Ancient writings.
### • For her thesis on Central American paleography, she spent a winter
### in Honduras studying rock inscriptions 30 miles upriver from the
### nearest town.
### The world's oldest literature dates from about 4,000 years ago, from
### the land known as Sumer (now southern Iraq). Early writing took the
### form of pictographs, very simple pictures that first represented
### things or ideas and later came to represent actual words. The first
### actual alphabet, in which each character represents a sound,
### appeared in the same general region about 500 years later. But
### writing developed in very different ways in different parts of the
### world, and 1,000 years later, when Europeans first arrived in the
### New World, alphabetic writing still wasn't being used anywhere in
### the Americas. Decoding some ancient languages has proven to be a
### huge task for paleographers, and determining the age and the
### source of a piece of writing can pose major challenges.

### paleontology
### A science dealing with the life of
### past geological periods as known from fossil remains.
### • Her obsession with dinosaurs as a child continued through her
### teens, and no one was surprised when she started graduate school
### in paleontology.
### Until the 1820s, hardly anyone even suspected that dinosaurs had
### ever existed. In the years since, paleontology has sought to discover
### the entire history of life on earth, from the era of single-celled
### organisms up into the human era. Paleontologists continue to make
### remarkable discoveries, such as that a huge meteorite that fell in the
### Gulf of Mexico wiped out the dinosaurs—all except the birds, the
### only surviving dinosaurs. “Radiometric dating” can reveal the age
### (often tens of millions of years) of a rock or fossil or a tiny grain of
### pollen by measuring how much its radioactive elements have
### disintegrated. The study of molecules of DNA, RNA, and proteins has
### also become important for dating. Paleontologists often consult with
### geologists searching for oil, gas, and coal deposits, since all these
### “fossil fuels” were formed from plant and animal remains.

### Paleozoic
### The era of geological history, ending
### about 248 million years ago, in which vertebrates and land plants
### first appeared.
### • His geological specialty was the beginning of the Paleozoic, from
### which the earliest fish fossils date.
### The Greek root zo- means “animal,” so names such as Paleozoic
### were invented to refer to a period in the development of animal life.
### For geologists, the Paleozoic era is followed by the Mesozoic (meso-
### meaning “middle”), which is followed by the Cenozoic (cen- meaning
### “recent”). Eras are huge stretches of time; geologists break eras
### down into smaller “periods” and “epochs.” Thus, the Paleozoic ends
### with the Permian period, the Mesozoic ends with the Upper
### Cretaceous epoch, and the Cenozoic ends with the Holocene epoch
### —the epoch in which we are living. The Paleozoic era produced the
### first fish, the first land plants, the first insects, and the first
### amphibians and reptiles; the dinosaurs, birds, and mammals had to
### wait for the Mesozoic.

### CIRCU/CIRCUM
### comes from the Latin circus, meaning “circle.” So
### a circus is traditionally held under a round tent. A circuit can be a
### tour around an area or territory, or the complete path of an electric
### current. To circumnavigate means “to navigate around”—often
### around the world.

### circuitous
### (1) Having a circular or winding course.
### (2) Not forthright or direct in action.
### • She sometimes arrives at her conclusions by circuitous reasoning
### that her students can't even follow.
### Circuitous is usually the opposite of direct, and it's generally used to
### describe either roads or explanations. Detours are usually circuitous,
### and a circuitous path, twisting and turning and cutting back on itself,
### is the kind of route you'd expect to find in the mountains. Lawyers
### often find themselves making circuitous arguments, which may get
### most circuitous when they're defending particularly undesirable
### clients.

### circumference
### (1) The perimeter or boundary of
### a circle. (2) The outer boundary or surface of a shape or object.
### • To calculate the circumference of a circle, multiply its diameter by
### 3.1416.
### Attempts have been made to measure the circumference of the
### earth since the time of Aristotle. The calculation that Columbus was
### relying on led him to think he could reach China by sailing west
### more quickly than by sailing east. But that measurement had
### calculated the earth's circumference as about a quarter too small,
### and the rest is history. Columbus wasn't the only one who got it
### wrong; many later attempts continued to produce different
### measurements for the earth's circumference—even though the
### Greeks had calculated it correctly way back in the 3rd century B.C.

### circumspect
### Careful
### to
### consider
### all
### circumstances and possible consequences; cautious.
### • Her answer was careful and circumspect, and I couldn't help
### thinking she knew a lot more than she was telling.
### Since spect- comes from the Latin word for “look,” circumspect
### basically means “looking around” yourself before you act. Being a
### doctor has traditionally called for a circumspect personality, which
### gives their patients confidence in them. Scholars are known for their
### circumspection, since there's nothing worse for scholars' reputations
### than mistakes in the books or articles they've written. Bankers once
### had a reputation for great circumspection, but the financial disaster
### of 2008 earned some bankers a very different kind of reputation.

### circumvent
### (1) To make a circuit around. (2) To
### manage to get around, especially by clever means.
### • We knew there was a traffic jam on the highway and circumvented
### it by using back roads.
### In mythology, a person's attempts to circumvent fate are almost
### always doomed. In the Iliad we're told of how Achilles' mother,
### Thetis, hoping to circumvent the prophecy that her child would die in
### a war against Troy, disguised the boy as a woman. But clever
### Odysseus, recruiting for the Greek army, arrived disguised as a
### peddler, and among the jewels he displayed to the women of the
### household he laid a sword. The young Achilles, ignoring the jewelry,
### immediately seized the sword, thereby identifying himself for what
### he was. Today we more often hear of attempts to circumvent the
### law, or at least some requirements that we'd rather not have to deal
### with.

### MINI/MINU
### come from Latin words meaning “small” and “least.”
### So the minimum is the least, and a minute amount is almost
### nothing. And mini- is all too familiar as a prefix that we've been
### applying to all kinds of things since the 1950s: minivan, miniskirt,
### mini-mart, minipark, and the rest.

### minimalism
### A style or technique (as in music,
### literature, or design) that is characterized by extreme spareness and
### simplicity.
### • He'd never understood what anyone liked about minimalism, since
### minimalist stories always seemed to leave out any description of
### people's characters and motivation and rarely even described their
### surroundings.
### In the 1960s, a few composers, including Philip Glass, Steve Reich,
### and John Adams, began writing music inspired by the music of India
### and Southeast Asia, often with a quick pulsing beat and chords that
### are repeated quickly over and over while small changes are slowly
### introduced. Minimalist art, which began appearing around the same
### time, tries to strip away all personal elements, often leaving only
### pure geometric forms; you may have seen the plain silver boxes of
### Donald Judd, or the straight neon tubes of Bruce Nauman. In
### literature, the stripped-down fiction of Samuel Beckett and Raymond
### Carver is often considered minimalist. But there's a real question
### whether these various types of minimalism should even be
### considered the same concept.

### minuscule
### Very small.
### • For someone who had been living on a minuscule budget since
### graduating from college, even the paycheck for a minimum-wage job
### felt like wealth to her.
### As a noun, minuscule means a style of ancient or medieval
### handwriting script with smaller letters than earlier scripts. There
### were actually several minuscules, but the most important was
### promoted from around A.D. 800 on by Charlemagne, who believed
### that any educated person in the Holy Roman Empire should be able
### to read the Latin written by anyone else. If you've ever looked at a
### medieval manuscript, you've probably seen minuscule script, along
### with so-called majuscule (for modern type, we would use the words
### lowercase and capital instead); even today most of us can read
### medieval minuscule and majuscule without too much trouble. Be
### careful about spelling minuscule; we tend to expect a word meaning
### “small” to begin with mini- rather than minu-.

### minutiae
### Very small or minor details.
### • She likes “thinking big,” and gets annoyed when her job requires
### her to deal with what she considers minutiae.
### As you might guess, this word comes straight from Latin. The
### Romans used it in its singular form, minutia, to mean “smallness,”
### and in the plural to mean “trifles”; today we almost always use it in
### the plural with that same “trifles” meaning. Hardly anyone ever talks
### about minutiae except to dismiss their importance. So you may talk
### about the minutiae of daily life or the minutiae of a contract, or
### about getting bogged down or buried in minutiae at the office. Just
### don't forget that the devil is often in the details.

### diminutive
### (1) Indicating small size. (2) Very small.
### • In German, Hänsel is a diminutive form of Hans (which is a
### diminutive form of Johannes), and Gretel is a diminutive form of
### Margaret.
### Just as diminish means “to grow smaller,” diminutive means “very
### small.” When writing about language, diminutive as both an
### adjective and a noun refers to particular endings and the words
### made with them to indicate smallness. In English, such endings
### include -et and -ette (piglet, dinette, cigarette, diskette) as well as -
### ie and -y (doggy, bootie, Bobby, Debbie). However, diminutives are
### more common in many other languages. Outside of language,
### diminutive is used for many things, including people (“She noticed a
### diminutive figure standing shyly by the door”), but often not very
### seriously (“We were served some rather diminutive rolls”).

### Answers

### INTER
### comes straight from Latin. In English it has various
### meanings; all of them can be expressed broadly as “between,” but
### they're
### still
### quite
### distinct:
### “moving
### between”
### (intercity),
### “communicating between” (intercom), “coming between” (intercept),
### and so on. No wonder so many English words begin with inter-.

### intercede
### (1) To act as a go-between between
### unfriendly parties. (2) To beg or plead in behalf of another.
### • He had interceded for her with their boss on one important
### occasion, for which she was still grateful.
### The Latin cedere means “to go,” so “go between” is the most literal
### meaning of intercede. (The same -cede root can also be seen in
### such words as precede and secede.) If you've been blamed unfairly
### for something, a friend may intercede on your behalf with your
### coach or teacher. More often, it will be the coach or teacher who has
### to intercede in a student dispute. The intercession of foreign
### governments has sometimes prevented conflicts from becoming
### worse than they otherwise would have.

### interstice
### A little space between two things; chink,
### crevice.
### • All the interstices between the rocks have been filled with new
### cement, and the wall should be fine for another hundred years.
### People often speak of interstices in the physical sense (referring to
### the interstices in surfaces, for example, or microscopic interstices
### between particles in chemical compounds), but also often in a less
### literal way (the interstices in a movie's plot, in the economy, in
### what's covered by a complicated tax law, etc.). The pronunciation of
### interstice is slightly unusual; you might not guess that it's accented
### on the second syllable. This is also true in the plural interstices,
### which is used more often than the singular form; note also that in
### interstices the final e is usually pronounced long, so that it rhymes
### with bees.

### interdict
### (1) To prohibit or forbid. (2) To destroy,
### damage, or cut off (as an enemy line of supply) by firepower to stop
### or hamper an enemy.
### • All weapons trade with the country had been interdicted by the
### NATO alliance, and ships were actually being stopped and searched
### before being allowed to dock.
### Interdict and interdiction are used for very serious prohibitions—
### more serious than, say, a professor telling the class that texting is
### forbidden during lectures. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance,
### an interdict was a sentence imposed by the powerful Catholic Church
### forbidding a person or place, and sometimes even an entire country,
### from receiving church privileges or participating in church functions.
### Interdict now often means “cut off” in a physically forceful way as
### well; interdictions are usually targeted at either arms supplies or
### illegal drug shipments.

### interpolate
### To put something between other things
### or parts, especially to put words into a piece of writing or a
### conversation.
### • On page 6, she noticed that someone had interpolated a couple of
### sentences that completely altered the meaning of her original text.
### The meaning of interpolate is often entirely innocent. An
### interpolation in a text may have been approved by everyone
### concerned, and an interpolation in conversation is usually just an
### interruption. But in its older meaning, interpolating usually meant
### tampering with a text secretly to change its apparent meaning.
### Legislators are sometimes enraged to discover what someone has
### quietly interpolated into their favorite bill at the last minute. And any
### contract always has to be read carefully to make sure the other
### lawyer didn't slip in an undesirable interpolation.

### SUR
### is actually a shortening of the Latin prefix super-, meaning
### “over, above” (see
### SUPER
### ), and has the same meaning. A surface is
### the face above or on the outside of something. A surplus is
### something above and beyond what is needed. And to survey a
### landscape is to look out over it.

### surmount
### To rise above; overcome.
### • The story of how he surmounted poverty and crippling physical
### ailments to achieve what he achieved is almost unbelievable.
### Our verb mount, meaning “ascend, get up onto,” comes from the
### same Latin root as mountain, and we keep those images in mind
### when using surmount, since climbing up or over a mountain is a
### symbol of achievement. The word almost always refers to human
### effort, and almost always in a positive way; thus, we speak of
### surmounting
### difficulties,
### surmounting
### problems,
### surmounting
### hurdles, surmounting handicaps—you get the idea.

### surcharge
### An additional tax or charge.
### • Checking the bill, she discovered two surcharges that no one had
### warned her about.
### The Arab oil embargo of 1973 led airlines to add fuel surcharges to
### their passenger fares that were large enough to discourage air
### travel. Surcharges are usually added for special service. When you
### request a “rush job” from a service supplier, it will probably bring a
### surcharge along with it. A particularly difficult phone installation may
### carry a surcharge. An extra-large fine for a speeding offense after
### you've already had too many tickets could be called a surcharge. An
### added tax may be called a surcharge (or surtax) when it only affects
### people with incomes above a certain level. And if those low, low
### prices that show up in really big letters in ads for all kinds of services
### turn out to be misleading, it's probably because they don't include a
### bunch of surcharges that you won't find out about till later.

### surfeit
### A supply that is more than enough; excess.
### • Whenever he glanced into his daughter's room, he was always
### astonished at the utter surfeit of things—dolls, dollhouses, stuffed
### animals, cushions, games, posters, and clothing strewn everywhere.
### Book and film critics often use surfeit when complaining about how
### an author or director has given us too much of something. In our
### consumer society, we're always noticing a surfeit of one thing or
### another, such as breakfast cereals in the supermarket. Statistics are
### always indicating a surfeit of lawyers or doctors or accountants in
### some parts of the country and a lack of them in others. The death of
### a young star always results in a surfeit of articles and books about
### him or her. And a potluck supper usually results in a surfeit of food,
### which might leave you surfeited, or stuffed.

### surreal
### Very strange or unusual; having the quality of a
### dream.
### • In a surreal sequence, the main character gets a job on floor 7
### 1/2, which turns out to be only half as high as the other floors, so
### everyone must walk around stooped over.
### In 1924 a group of European poets, painters, and filmmakers
### founded a movement that they called Surrealism. Their central idea
### was that the unconscious mind (a concept Sigmund Freud had
### recently made famous) was the source of all imagination, and that
### art should try to express its contents. The unconscious, they
### believed, revealed itself most clearly in dreams. The Surrealist
### painters included René Magritte, Joan Miró, and Salvador Dalí,
### whose “limp watches” painting became the best-known Surrealist
### image of all. Since those years, we've used surreal to describe all
### kinds of situations that strike us as dreamlike. And even though the
### Surrealist movement ended long ago, surrealism now seems to be
### everywhere—not just in painting, literature, and movies but also in
### blogs, video games, and graphic novels.

### CO
### is a Latin prefix that generally means “with, together,” and we
### see it daily in such words as costar, cofounder, co-owner, and
### coworker. But many other co- words aren't quite so easy to
### understand when you first encounter them.

### coalesce
### To come together to form one group or mass.
### • Three local civic groups have recently coalesced to form a single
### organization, believing it will result in more effective campaigns.
### Social movements are often said to coalesce when groups with
### somewhat different interests realize how much they have in
### common. Some physicists believe that planets coalesced not from
### space rocks but from icy clouds of cosmic dust. Some people even
### study how languages coalesce—for example, the fairly new language
### Afrikaans, a mixture of Dutch and native languages spoken in South
### Africa, which only really solidified about 150 years ago.

### cogeneration
### The production of electricity
### using waste heat (as in steam) from an industrial process, or the use
### of steam from electric power generation as a source of heat.
### • With its new cogeneration system, the company reports converting
### over 65% of the energy in natural gas to electricity, making this the
### most efficient power plant ever built.
### Cogeneration is basically the production of energy and usable heat
### (generally in the form of steam and hot water) in the same plant,
### usually by capturing heat that in older plants used to be simply
### wasted. It's one of the principal ways in which countries intend to
### reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions so as to slow climate change.
### Cogeneration plants are often small, and the fuels used in them are
### varied. Lumber mills, for instance, can operate their own
### cogeneration plants, feeding them with wood scraps and sawdust,
### and wastewater treatment plants generate gas that can likewise be
### used as a source of energy. Since it's hard to move heat long
### distances, cogeneration is most efficient when the heat can be used
### nearby. Though the general public today knows little about
### cogeneration, more and more of us will be benefiting from it in the
### coming years.

### codependency
### A psychological condition or a
### relationship in which a person is controlled or manipulated by
### someone affected with a condition such as alcohol or drug addiction.
### • She never knew what codependency was until her daughter took
### up with a mean, abusive alcoholic and refused to leave him.
### Dependency on addictive substances has been known for centuries,
### but the concept of codependency got its name only as recently as
### 1979. For many of us, codependency isn't easy to understand; we
### may keep asking “Why doesn't she just leave him?” and find it hard
### to accept the answers we get. Codependents usually don't share
### their partners' addiction, but their lives tend to be taken over with
### the burden of caring for and protecting the spouse or partner. In
### recent years, people have started claiming that all kinds of
### conditions—anorexia, overeating, gambling, fear of intimacy, etc.—
### can result in codependency. Many experts think all of this has gone
### too far; still, almost everyone agrees that spouses of alcoholics and
### drug addicts face unique difficulties and should look for support and
### advice anywhere they can find it.

### cohesion
### (1) The action or state of sticking together.
### (2) Molecular attraction by which the particles of a body are united
### throughout the mass.
### • The party's greatest strength was its cohesion and discipline, and
### on bill after bill that year not a single member voted with the other
### party.
### Cohesion is one of the noun forms of cohere; the others are
### cohesiveness and coherence, each of which has a slightly different
### meaning. Coherence is often used to describe a person's speech or
### writing. An incoherent talk or blog post is one that doesn't “hang
### together”; and if the police pick up someone who they describe as
### incoherent, it means he or she isn't making sense. But to describe a
### group or team that always sticks together, you would use cohesive,
### not coherent. And the words you'd use in Chemistry class to describe
### the way molecules hang together—for example, the way water forms
### into beads and drops—are cohesion, cohesive, and cohesiveness.

### SYN
### is a Greek and Latin prefix meaning “together” or “at the same
### time.” So “in sync” (short for “in synchronization”) means “together
### in time.” And a synonym is a word that can be considered together
### with another word since it has the same meaning.

### syntax
### The way in which words are put together to form
### phrases, clauses, or sentences.
### • The president's critics complain about his odd and confusing
### syntax when he speaks in public.
### Syntax is basically about what word comes before and after another
### word; in other words, it's part of the larger subject of grammar.
### Syntax is often an issue in poetry, and it's usually discussed in
### connection with diction—that is, the poet's choice of words. So, for
### example, your English professor might point out the syntactic
### difference between “Whose woods these are I think I know” and “I
### think I know whose woods these are”; whereas if the discussion was
### about diction instead, the question might be about the choice of
### “woods” rather than “land,” or “think” rather than “bet.”

### synthesize
### To make something by combining
### different things.
### • From all the proposals put in front of us, we were asked to
### synthesize a plan that could get the support of the whole group.
### Synthesize is a very common word in chemistry, since chemists are
### constantly
### synthesizing
### new
### compounds—that
### is,
### synthetic
### compounds—including drugs and industrial chemicals. It's also often
### used when talking about writing; nonfiction writers must often
### synthesize large amounts of material from many sources to produce
### a book—which represents a synthesis of the important materials. An
### electronic synthesizercreates new sounds (which may imitate the
### sounds of acoustic instruments) by generating different basic tones
### and then manipulating and merging them together with others.

### synergy
### The increased effectiveness that results when
### two or more people or businesses work together.
### • With the first company's importance in print media and the
### second's success on the Web, everyone was convinced that the
### merger would result in an awesome synergy.
### An old saying, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,”
### expresses the basic meaning of synergy. The word is sometimes
### used in a purely physical sense, especially when talking about drugs;
### sometimes a “cocktail” of drugs may be more effective than the sum
### of the effectiveness of each of the separate drugs. But the word is
### best known in the world of business. The notion that, when the right
### two companies merge, they'll produce a profitable synergy seemed
### exciting in the 1990s, when synergy became a trendy buzzword
### (even though it's actually been around since the 17th century). The
### idea of synergy was one factor in what became a “merger mania”;
### unfortunately, business synergy often turned out to be harder to
### achieve than to imagine.

### syndrome
### A group of signs and symptoms that occur
### together and characterize a particular abnormality or condition.
### • When there is no trembling—the most obvious symptom of
### Parkinson's disease—most doctors fail to recognize the Parkinson's
### syndrome.
### Combining its two Greek roots, syndrome means basically “running
### together.” So when diagnosing a condition or disease, doctors tend
### to look for a group of symptoms existing together. As long as a set
### of symptoms remains mysterious, it may be referred to as a specific
### syndrome. But if that name is used for a while, it may become the
### condition's permanent name, even after an underlying cause has
### been found. So today we have Down syndrome, acquired immune
### deficiency syndrome, Asperger's syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome,
### chronic fatigue syndrome, Tourette's syndrome, sick building
### syndrome, and many more. And since mental conditions often turn
### out to have physical causes, syndrome is used in psychology as well
### as in medicine.

## Words from Mythology and History
### Adonis
### A very handsome young man.
### • Conversation in the little clusters of girls suddenly stops whenever
### this Adonis—blond, muscular, with an athlete's gait—swaggers down
### the school corridor.
### Adonis, like Narcissus (see
### narcissism
### ), was a beautiful youth in
### Greek mythology. He was loved by both Aphrodite, goddess of love
### and beauty, and Persephone, goddess of the underworld. One day
### while hunting, he was killed by a wild boar. In answer to Aphrodite's
### pleas, Zeus allowed him to spend half the year with her and half in
### the underworld. Today a man called an Adonis probably has
### strikingly fine features, low body fat, rippling muscles—and a certain
### vain attitude of overconfidence. Adonises should beware; the boar
### that killed Adonis was sent by either the jealous Artemis (goddess of
### hunting) or the envious Ares (god of war).

### amazon
### A tall, strong, often masculine woman.
### • I was greeted by the team's captain, a robust, broad-shouldered
### amazon who gripped my hand with crushing force.
### In Greek mythology, an Amazon was a member of a race of women
### warriors. One of the famous labors of Heracles (Hercules) was to
### obtain the sash of the Amazon queen Hippolyta, and the hero
### Theseus married Hippolyta's sister. The Amazon River got its name
### when, in 1542, the first Europeans to descend the river were
### attacked by Indian warriors who, even at close range, they believed
### to be women. The mystery of these warriors continues to this day.
### However impressive a figure they cut, though, not every tall and
### strong woman today would take it as a compliment to be called an
### amazon.

### chimera
### An often grotesque creature of the imagination.
### • This latest piece of legislation is a weird chimera, with sections
### devoted to agriculture, defense, welfare, law enforcement, and
### scientific research.
### In Greek mythology, the Chimera was a fire-breathing she-monster
### with a lion's head, a goat's body, and a dragon's tail, which laid
### waste the countryside in southwestern Turkey. It was finally killed by
### the hero Bellerophon, whose flying horse, Pegasus, enabled him to
### attack from the air. Over time, chimera came to be used for any
### imaginary monster made up of strange and mismatched parts; today
### it's the name of several species of truly bizarre-looking fish. But
### more commonly a chimera is a fantasy, an illusion, a figment of the
### imagination, or a dream that will never come true.

### cornucopia
### (1) A container shaped like a hollow
### horn full of fruits, vegetables, and ears of grain. (2) An abundance of
### something desirable.
### • These books were a cornucopia of wonderful stories and poems,
### and as a child I spent countless hours with them.
### The Latin term cornu copiae meant “horn of plenty,” and cornucopia
### and horn of plenty have both been used in English since the 16th
### century. Both terms refer to a hollow goat's horn, or a wicker basket
### shaped like one, overflowing with produce from the harvest. The
### cornucopia has been used as a decorative image to represent
### abundance since at least the 5th century B.C., when it represented a
### gift given by the infant god Zeus to his beloved nurse: a broken
### goat's horn that would always magically be filled with whatever she
### wanted. In the U.S., cornucopias are often seen on altars, in store-
### window displays, and as table centerpieces, especially at harvesttime
### or Thanksgiving.

### Elysium
### A place or condition of ideal happiness;
### paradise.
### • They had named their estate Elysium, and as we gazed out over its
### fountains, ponds, and sweeping lawns we could see why.
### This word came into Latin from the Greek Elysion. In classical
### mythology, Elysium, or the Elysian fields, was the home of the
### blessed after death, the final resting place of the souls of the heroic
### and the pure. So it's easy to see how the word came to mean any
### place or state of bliss or delight. When we try to picture heaven,
### many of us probably see a lovely park; the great boulevard of Paris
### was named for the beautiful park that originally bordered it: the
### Champs-Elysées, or Elysian Fields.

### epicure
### A person with cultivated taste, especially for
### food and drink; a gourmet.
### • He reads trashy novels and watches junk on TV, but he has an
### epicure's love of fine cheeses and wines.
### The Greek philosopher Epicurus was known for his original thinking
### about the nature of matter, but he's best remembered for his ideas
### about pleasure as the chief aim of life. By pleasure Epicurus chiefly
### meant the absence of pain and anxiety. However, over the years
### Epicureanism has come to mean a delight in fine sensual pleasures,
### and today an epicure is someone with refined taste, especially in
### food and wine. To display your own refined taste in language, you
### might try using epicure and epicurean in place of the overused
### gourmet.

### exodus
### A situation in which many people leave a place
### at the same time.
### • The war led to a mass exodus of Iraq's Christians.
### The second book of the Old Testament tells of the departure of
### Moses and the Israelites from Egypt and their difficult journey across
### the Sinai Desert to Mount Sinai, from which they would eventually
### complete their journey to their home in Palestine. The book's original
### Hebrew name was Shemot, but it's known to English-speakers as
### Exodus, from the Greek exodos, “departure.” Leon Uris chose the
### name Exodus for his powerful novel about the founding of Israel in
### the years after World War II, since the new state's postwar settlers
### had departed from many parts of the world for their new home in
### Palestine.

### gorgon
### An ugly, repulsive, or terrifying woman.
### • The beautiful star disappeared into the makeup room and emerged
### two hours later transformed into a gorgon.
### The Gorgons were three monstrous sisters in Greek mythology, the
### most famous of whom was Medusa. They had snakes for hair, and
### anyone who looked directly at them was immediately turned to
### stone. Medusa herself was finally beheaded by the hero Perseus,
### who avoided looking straight at her by instead watching her
### reflection in his mirrorlike shield. Today the familiar types of jellyfish,
### with long snakelike tentacles descending from their headlike bodies,
### are known as medusas.
