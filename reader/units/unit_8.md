### PORT
### comes from the Latin verb portare, meaning “to carry.” Thus,
### something portable can be carried around. A porter carries your
### luggage, whether through a train station or high into the Himalayas.
### When we transport something, we have it carried from one place to
### another. And goods for export are carried away to another country.

### portage
### The carrying of boats or goods overland from one
### body of water to another; also, a regular route for such carrying.
### • The only portage on the whole canoe route would be the one
### around the great waterfall on our second day.
### Portage was borrowed from French back in the 15th century to
### mean “carrying, transporting” or “freight,” and it has kept its simple
### “carrying” sense to the present day. But its first known use in its
### “carrying of boats” sense came in 1698, and the obstacle that the
### canoes couldn't be steered over was none other than Niagara Falls.
### Though canoes are much lighter today than they used to be, a long
### portage that includes a lot of camping gear can still test a camper's
### strength.

### portfolio
### (1) A flat case for carrying documents or
### artworks. (2) The investments owned by a person or organization.
### • In those days, a graphic artist who had recently moved to New
### York would just schlep his portfolio around to every magazine office
### in the city.
### Portfolio is partly based on the Latin folium, meaning “leaf, sheet.” A
### portfolio usually represents a portable showcase of your talents.
### Today actual portfolios are used less than they used to be by artists,
### since most commercial artists have a Web site dedicated to showing
### off their art. But portfolio in its other common meaning is extremely
### common. Not so long ago, a broker would keep each of his or her
### clients' investments in a separate notebook or portfolio. Today the
### investment portfolio, like an artist's portfolio, usually takes the form
### of a Web page, even though everyone still uses the same old word.

### comport
### (1) To be in agreement with. (2) To behave.
### • This new evidence comports with everything we know about what
### happened that night.
### With its prefix com-, “with,” the Latin word comportare meant “to
### bring together.” So it's easy to see how in English we could say that
### a college's policy comports with state law, or that a visit to your
### parents doesn't comport with your other weekend plans, or that your
### aunt and uncle won't listen to anything on TV that doesn't comport
### with their prejudices. The “behave” sense of the word comes
### through French, and its essential meaning is how a person “carries”
### him- or herself. So you may say, for instance, that your 17-year-old
### comported himself well (for once!) at the wedding reception, or that
### an ambassador always comports herself with dignity—that is, her
### comportment is always dignified—or that your class comported itself
### in a way that was a credit to the school.

### deportment
### Manner of conducting oneself socially.
### • At social events she would constantly sneak glances at Alexandra,
### in quiet admiration of her elegant and graceful deportment.
### We've all seen pictures of girls walking around balancing books on
### their heads in an effort to achieve the poise of a princess or a film
### star. Classes in deportment were once a standard part of a young
### lady's upbringing, offered in all the girls' colleges; and you can still
### take private deportment classes, where you'll learn about posture
### and body language, how to move, sit, stand, shake hands, dress,
### drink and eat, and much more. But deportment isn't all about refined
### female grace. In fact, deport is often used as a synonym for
### comport, but usually in a positive way; thus, people are often said to
### deport themselves well, confidently, with dignity, like gentlemen or
### ladies, and so on.

### PEND
### comes from the Latin verb pendere, meaning “to hang” or “to
### weigh.” (In the Roman era, weighing something large often required
### hanging it from a hook on one side of the balance scales.) We find
### the root in English words like appendix, referring to that useless and
### sometimes troublesome tube that hangs from the intestine, or that
### section at the back of some books that might contain some useful
### additional information.

### pendant
### Something that hangs down, especially as an
### ornament.
### • Around her neck she was wearing the antique French pendant he
### had given her, with its three rubies set in silver filigree.
### Most pendants are purely decorative. But a pendant may also hold a
### picture or a lock of hair of a lover or a child. And, perhaps because
### they hang protectively in front of the body and near the heart,
### pendants have often had symbolic and magical purposes. Thus, a
### pendant may be a charm or amulet, or its gems or metals may be
### felt to have health-giving properties. In architecture, a pendant is an
### ornament that hangs down from a structure, but unlike a necklace
### pendant it's usually solid and inflexible.

### append
### To add as something extra.
### • She appended to the memo a list of the specific items that the
### school was most in need of.
### Append is a somewhat formal word. Lawyers, for example, often
### speak of appending items to other documents, and lawmakers
### frequently append small bills to big ones, hoping that everyone will
### be paying attention only to the main part of the big bill and won't
### notice. When we append a small separate section to the end of a
### report or a book, we call it an appendix. But in the early years of e-
### mail, the words we decided on were attach and attachment,
### probably because appendixes are thought of as unimportant,
### whereas the attachment is often the whole reason for sending an e-
### mail.

### appendage
### (1) Something joined on to a larger or more
### important body or thing. (2) A secondary body part, such as an arm
### or a leg.
### • She often complained that she felt like a mere appendage of her
### husband when they socialized with his business partners.
### Appendix isn't the only noun that comes from append. Unlike
### appendix, appendage doesn't suggest the end of something, but
### simply something attached. The word is often used in biology to
### refer to parts of an animal's body: an insect's antennae, mouthparts,
### or wings, for example. The appendages of some animals will grow
### back after they've been removed; a salamander, for example, can
### regrow a finger, and the tiny sea squirt can regrow all its
### appendages—and even its brain.

### suspend
### (1) To stop something, or to force someone to
### give up some right or position, for a limited time. (2) To hang
### something so that it is free on all sides.
### • The country has been suspended from the major trade
### organizations, and the effects on its economy are beginning to be
### felt.
### When something is suspended, it is “left hanging”; it is neither in full
### operation nor permanently ended. Suspense is a state of uncertainty
### and maybe anxiety. When we watch a play or movie, we enjoy
### experiencing a “suspension of disbelief”; that is, we allow ourselves
### to believe we're watching reality, even though we aren't truly
### fooled.Suspension can also mean physical hanging; thus, in a
### suspension bridge, the roadway actually hangs from huge cables.
### When some substance is “in suspension,” its particles are “hanging”
### in another substance, mixed into it but not actually dissolved, like
### fine sand in water, or sea spray in the air at the seashore.

### Answers

### PAN
### comes from a Greek word meaning “all”; as an English prefix, it
### can also mean “completely,” “whole,” or “general.” A panoramic view
### is a complete view in every direction. A pantheon is a temple
### dedicated to all the gods of a religion. A pandemic outbreak of a
### disease may not affect the entire human population, but enough to
### produce a catastrophe.

### panacea
### A remedy for all ills or difficulties; cure-all.
### • Educational reform is sometimes viewed as the panacea for all of
### society's problems.
### Panacea comes from a Greek word meaning “all-healing,” and
### Panacea was the goddess of healing. In the Middle Ages and the
### Renaissance, alchemists who sought to concoct the “elixir of life”
### (which would give eternal life) and the “philosopher's stone” (which
### would turn ordinary metals into gold) also labored to find the
### panacea. But no such medicine was ever found, just as no solution
### to all of a society's difficulties has ever been found. Thus, panacea is
### almost always used to criticize the very idea of a total solution
### (“There's no panacea for the current problems plaguing Wall
### Street”).

### pandemonium
### A wild uproar or commotion.
### • Pandemonium erupted in the stadium as the ball shot past the
### goalie into the net.
### In John Milton's Paradise Lost, the fallen Satan has his heralds
### proclaim
### “A
### solemn
### Councel
### forthwith
### to
### be
### held
### /
### At
### Pandaemonium, the high Capital / Of Satan and his Peers.” Milton
### got the name for his capital of hell, where Satan gathered together
### all his demons, by linking pan with the Latin word daemonium, “evil
### spirit.” For later writers, pandemonium became a synonym for hell
### itself, since hell was then often seen as a place of constant noise and
### confusion, but also for any wicked and lawless place. Nowadays it's
### used to refer to the uproar itself rather than the place where it
### occurs.

### pantheism
### A system of belief that regards God as
### identical with the forces and laws of the universe.
### • Most of her students seemed to accept a vague kind of pantheism,
### without any real belief that God had ever appeared in human form.
### Pantheistic ideas—and most importantly the belief that God is equal
### to the universe, its physical matter, and the forces that govern it—
### are found in the ancient books of Hinduism, in the works of many
### Greek philosophers, and in later works of philosophy and religion
### over the centuries. Much modern New Age spirituality is pantheistic.
### But most Christian thinkers reject pantheism because it makes God
### too impersonal, doesn't allow for any difference between the
### creation and the creator, and doesn't seem to allow for humans to
### make meaningful moral choices.

### panoply
### (1) A magnificent or impressive array. (2) A
### display of all appropriate accessory items.
### • The full panoply of a royal coronation was a thrilling sight for the
### throngs of sidewalk onlookers and the millions of television viewers.
### The fully armed Greek soldier was an impressive sight, even if Greek
### armor never became as heavy as that of medieval knights on
### horseback (who couldn't possibly have marched in such outfits).
### Panoplia was the Greek word for the full suit of armor, and the
### English panoply originally likewise referred to the full suit of armor
### worn by a soldier or knight. Today panoply may refer to full
### ceremonial dress or lavish ceremonial decoration of any kind. And it
### can also refer to striking spectacle of almost any kind: the
### breathtaking panoply of autumn foliage, or the stirring panoply of a
### military parade, for example.

### EXTRA
### is
### Latin
### for
### “outside”
### or
### “beyond.”
### So
### anything
### extraterrestrial or extragalactic takes place beyond the earth or the
### galaxy. Something extravagant, such as an extravaganza, goes way
### beyond the normal. And extra is naturally a word itself, a shortening
### of extraordinary, “beyond the ordinary.”

### extradite
### To deliver an accused criminal from one
### place to another where the trial will be held.
### • Picked up by the Colorado police for burglary, he's being extradited
### to Mississippi to face trial for murder.
### Extradition from one state to another is generally a straightforward
### process. But extradition may become more complicated when two
### countries are involved, even though most countries have signed
### treaties stating that they will send criminals to the country where
### they are wanted. Many countries often won't send their own citizens
### to another country for trial; countries that don't permit the death
### penalty may not agree to send a suspect back to face such a
### penalty; and most countries won't extradite someone accused of
### political crimes. When extradition seems unlikely, a country may
### actually kidnap someone from another country, but this is illegal and
### rare.

### extrapolate
### To extend or project facts or data into
### an area not known in order to make assumptions or to predict facts
### or trends.
### • Economists predict future buying trends partly by extrapolating
### from current economic data.
### Scientists worry about the greenhouse effect because they have
### extrapolated the rate of carbon-dioxide buildup and predicted that its
### effect on the atmosphere will become increasingly severe. On the
### basis of their extrapolations, they have urged governments and
### businesses to limit factory and automobile emissions. Notice that it's
### acceptable to speak of extrapolating existing data (to produce new
### data), extrapolating from existing data (to produce new data), or
### extrapolating new data (from existing data)—in other words, it isn't
### easy to use this word wrong.

### extrovert
### A person mainly concerned with things
### outside him- or herself; a sociable and outgoing person.
### • These parties are always full of loud extroverts, and I always find
### myself hiding in a corner with my drink.
### Extrovert (sometimes spelled extravert) means basically “turned
### outward”—that is, toward things outside oneself. The word was
### coined by the eminent psychologist C. G. Jung in the early 20th
### century. The opposite personality type, in Jung's view, was the
### introvert. Extroverts seem to be favored by societies such as ours,
### even though introverts seem to be on average more mentally gifted.
### Psychologists have said that the only personality traits that can be
### identified in newborn infants are shyness and lack of shyness, which
### are fairly close to—but not really the same as—introversion and
### extroversion.

### extraneous
### (1) Existing or coming from the
### outside. (2) Not forming an essential part; irrelevant.
### • Be sure your essays are well focused, with any discussion of
### extraneous topics kept to a minimum.
### Extraneous and strange both come from the same Latin word,
### extraneus, which basically meant “external” or “coming from
### outside.” But unlike strange, extraneous is a slightly formal word,
### often used by scientists and social scientists. Researchers always try
### to eliminate extraneous factors (or “extraneous variables”) from their
### studies. A researcher conducting a psychological test, for example,
### would try to make sure that the people were tested under the same
### conditions, and were properly divided according to gender, age,
### health, and so on.

### PHOT
### comes from the Greek word for “light.” Photography uses light
### to create an image on film or paper, and a photocopy is an image
### made by using light and tiny electrically charged ink particles.

### photoelectric
### Involving an electrical effect
### produced by the action of light or other radiation.
### • They wanted to avoid the kind of smoke detector that uses
### radioactive materials, so they've installed the photoelectric kind
### instead.
### The photoelectric effect occurs when light (or similar radiation such
### as X-rays) falls on a material such as a metal plate and causes it to
### emit electrons. The discovery of the photoelectric effect led to
### important new theories about matter (and to a Nobel Prize for Albert
### Einstein). Photoelectric cells, or photocells, are used in burglar-alarm
### light detectors and garage-door openers (both employ a beam of
### light that is broken when something moves across it), and also to
### play soundtracks on movie film (where a light beam shines through
### the soundtrack encoded on the film and is “read” by the photocells).

### photovoltaic
### Involving the direct generation of
### electricity when sunlight or other radiant energy falls on the
### boundary between dissimilar substances (such as two different
### semiconductors).
### • Photovoltaic technology is being applied to thin film that can
### produce as much energy as solar cells while using far less
### semiconducting material.
### The -voltaic part of photovoltaic comes from the name of Alessandro
### Volta, inventor of the electric battery. Thus, unlike photoelectric cells,
### which use electricity for certain small tasks, photovoltaic (or PV) cells
### actually produce electricity. Solar cells, the standard type of
### photovoltaic cells (often called simply photocells), operate without
### chemicals and with no moving parts to create energy directly from
### sunlight. Much research is now being done on creating an alternative
### technology—solar film, which could be stuck onto almost any
### surface, or possibly even sprayed on.

### photon
### A tiny particle or bundle of radiant energy.
### • The idea that light consists of photons is difficult until you begin to
### think of a ray of light as being caused by a stream of tiny particles.
### It was Albert Einstein who first theorized that the energy in a light
### beam exists in small bits or particles, and scientists today know that
### light sometimes behaves like a wave (somewhat like sound or water)
### and sometimes like a stream of particles. The energies of photons
### range from high-energy gamma rays and X-rays down to low-energy
### infrared and radio waves, though all travel at the same speed. The
### amazing power of lasers is the result of a concentration of photons
### that have been made to travel together in order to hit their target at
### the same time.

### photosynthesis
### The process by which green
### plants use light to produce organic matter from carbon dioxide and
### water.
### • Sagebrush survives in harsh climates because it's capable of
### carrying on photosynthesis at very low temperatures.
### The Greek roots of photosynthesis combine to produce the basic
### meaning “to put together with the help of light.” Photosynthesis is
### what first produced oxygen in the atmosphere billions of years ago,
### and it's still what keeps it there. Sunlight splits the water molecules
### (made of hydrogen and oxygen) held in a plant's leaves and releases
### the oxygen in them into the air. The leftover hydrogen combines
### with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates, which the plant uses
### as food—as do any animals or humans who might eat the plant.

### LUC
### comes from the Latin noun lux, “light,” and the verb lucere, “to
### shine or glitter.” In ancient Rome, Lucifer, meaning “Light-bearer,”
### was the name given to the morning star, but the name was
### eventually transferred by Christians to Satan. This tradition, which
### dates back to the period before Christ, said that Lucifer had once
### been among the angels but had wanted to be the great light in the
### sky, and for his pride had been cast out of heaven and thus became
### the opponent of everything good.

### lucid
### (1) Very clear and easy to understand. (2) Able to
### think clearly.
### • On his last visit he had noticed that his elderly mother hadn't
### seemed completely lucid.
### Mental lucidity is easy to take for granted when we're young, though
### alcohol, drugs, and psychological instability can confuse the mind at
### any age. We all hope to live to 100 with our mental abilities intact,
### which is entirely possible; avoiding the condition called dementia
### (which includes the well-known Alzheimer's disease) often involves a
### combination of decent genes, physical and mental activity, and a
### good diet. Writing lucidly, on the other hand, can take a lot of work
### at any age; you've probably had the experience of trying to read a
### set of instructions and wondering if the writer even grew up
### speaking English.

### elucidate
### To clarify by explaining; explain.
### • A good doctor should always be willing to elucidate any medical
### jargon he or she uses.
### The basic meaning of elucidate is “to shed light on.” So when you
### elucidate, you make transparent or clear something that had been
### murky or confusing. Elucidation of a complex new health-care policy
### may be a challenge. Elucidation of the terms of use for a credit card
### may be the last thing its provider wants to do. The physicist Carl
### Sagan had a gift for elucidating astronomical science to a large
### audience, his lucid explanations making clear how stars are born and
### die and how the universe may have begun.

### lucubration
### (1) Hard and difficult study. (2)
### The product of such study.
### • Our professor admitted that he wasn't looking forward to reading
### through any more of our lucubrations on novels that no one enjoyed.
### Lucubration came to mean “hard study” because it originally meant
### study done by lamplight, and in a world without electric lights, such
### study was likely to be the kind of hard work that would only a
### dedicated student like Abe Lincoln would make a habit of. The word
### has a literary feel to it, and it's often used with a touch of sarcasm.

### translucent
### Partly transparent; allowing light to
### pass through without permitting objects beyond to be seen clearly.
### • Architects today often use industrial glass bricks in their home
### designs, because translucent walls admit daylight while guarding
### privacy.
### With its prefix trans-, meaning “through,” translucent describes
### material that light shines through without making anything on the
### other side clearly visible, unlike a transparent material. Frosted
### glass, often used in bathroom windows, is translucent, as is stained
### glass. Red wine in a crystal goblet, when held before a candle in a
### dark corner of a quiet restaurant, usually proves to be translucent as
### well.

### MOR/MORT
### comes from Latin words meaning “to die” and “death.”
### A mortuary is a place where dead bodies are kept until burial, and a
### postmortem examination is one conducted on a recently dead body.
### The Latin phrase “Memento mori” means “Remember that you must
### die”; so a memento mori is the name we give to a reminder of
### death; the skulls you can find carved on gravestones in old
### cemeteries are examples.

### mortality
### (1) The quality or state of being alive and
### therefore certain to die. (2) The number of deaths that occur in a
### particular time or place.
### • Mortality rates were highest among those who those who lived
### closest to the plant.
### Young people tend to assume they will never die; but a person's
### sense of his or her mortality generally increases year by year, and
### often increases greatly after a serious accident or illness. Still, many
### people refuse to change behaviors that would improve their chances
### of living into old age. Mortality rates are calculated by government
### agencies, insurance companies, and medical researchers. Infant
### mortality rates (the rate at which infants die in childbirth) provide a
### good indicator of a country's overall health; in recent years, the
### rates in countries like Iceland, Singapore, and Japan have been
### much better than in the U.S.

### moribund
### (1) In the process of dying or
### approaching death. (2) Inactive or becoming outmoded.
### • Church attendance in Britain has fallen in recent years, but no one
### would say the Anglican church is moribund.
### Moribund is still sometimes used in its original literal sense of
### “approaching death,” but it's much more often used to describe
### things. When the economy goes bad, we hear about moribund mills
### and factories and towns; the economy itself may even be called
### moribund. Critics may speak of the moribund state of poetry, or
### lament the moribund record or newspaper industry.

### amortize
### To pay off (something such as a mortgage)
### by making small payments over a period of time.
### • For tax purposes, they chose to amortize most of the business's
### start-up costs over a three-year period.
### Amortize is most common as a legal term, and many of us first come
### across it when we take out a mortgage or start a business. Financial
### officers and tax lawyers can choose how to legally amortize various
### types of business expenses, some of which may seem much better
### than others. In mortgage amortization, much of what you pay month
### by month is actually interest on the mortgage debt, especially at the
### beginning. So what does amortizing have to do with death?
### Basically, to amortize a debt means to “kill” it slowly over time.

### mortify
### (1) To subdue or deaden (the body) especially
### by self-discipline or self-inflicted pain. (2) To embarrass greatly.
### • Our 14-year-old is mortified whenever he sees us dancing,
### especially if any of his school friends are around.
### Mortify once actually meant “put to death,” but no longer. Its
### “deaden” sense is most familiar to us in the phrase “mortifying the
### flesh,” which refers to a custom once followed by devout Christians,
### who would starve themselves, deprive themselves of every comfort,
### and even whip themselves in order to subdue their bodily desires
### and punish themselves for their sins. But the most common use of
### mortify today is the “humiliate” sense; its connection with death is
### still apparent when we speak of “dying of embarrassment.”

### TROPH
### comes from the Greek trophe, meaning “nourishment.” This
### particular troph- root doesn't show up in many everyday English
### words (the troph- in words like trophy, apostrophe, and catastrophe
### has a different meaning), but instead tends to appear in scientific
### terms.

### atrophy
### (1) Gradual loss of muscle or flesh, usually
### because of disease or lack of use. (2) A decline or degeneration.
### • After a month in a hospital bed, my father required a round of
### physical therapy to deal with his muscular atrophy.
### From its literal Greek roots, atrophy would mean basically “lack of
### nourishment.” Although the English word doesn't usually imply any
### lack of food, it always refers to a wasting away. Those who have
### been bedridden for a period of time will notice that their muscles
### have atrophied. And muscular atrophy is a frequent result of such
### diseases as cancer and AIDS. We also use atrophy in a much more
### general sense. After being out of work a few years, you may find
### your work skills have atrophied; someone who's been living an
### isolated life may discover the same thing about his or her social
### skills; and a democracy can atrophy when its citizens cease to pay
### attention to how they're being governed.

### hypertrophy
### (1) Excessive development of an organ
### or part. (2) Exaggerated growth or complexity.
### • Opponents claimed that the Defense Department, after years of
### being given too much money by the Congress, was now suffering
### from hypertrophy.
### When the prefix hyper-, “above, beyond” (see
### HYPER
### ), is joined to -
### trophy, we get the opposite of atrophy. An organ or part becomes
### hypertrophic when it grows so extremely that its function is affected.
### Muscle hypertrophy is common in men who do strength training, and
### is often harmless; but extreme muscle hypertrophy generally
### involves taking steroids, which can do great damage to the body.
### Hypertrophy of the heart sounds as if it might be healthy, but
### instead it's usually a bad sign. As the example sentence shows,
### hypertrophy, like atrophy, can be used in nonmedical ways as well.

### dystrophy
### Any of several disorders involving the nerves
### and muscles, especially muscular dystrophy.
### • The most common of the muscular dystrophies affects only males,
### who rarely live to the age of 40.
### Since the prefix dys- means “bad” or “difficult” (see
### DYS
### ), dystrophy
### is always a negative term. Originally it meant “a condition caused by
### improper nutrition,” but today the term is instead used for a variety
### of other conditions, particularly conditions that noticeably affect the
### muscles. Of the many types of muscular dystrophy, the best known
### is Duchenne's, a terrible disease that strikes about one in 3,300
### males and produces severe wasting of the muscles. However, the
### muscular dystrophies generally affect many other organs and
### systems as well. And the other dystrophies, which tend to involve
### the eyes or hands, don't much resemble the muscular dystrophies.

### eutrophication
### The process by which a body
### of water becomes enriched in dissolved nutrients.
### • Local naturalists are getting worried about the increasing
### eutrophication they've been noticing in the lake.
### Eutrophication, which comes from the Greek eutrophos, “well-
### nourished” (see
### EU
### ), has become a major environmental problem.
### Nitrates and phosphates, especially from lawn fertilizers, run off the
### land into rivers and lakes, promoting the growth of algae and other
### plant life, which take oxygen from the water, causing the death of
### fish and mollusks. Cow manure, agricultural fertilizer, detergents,
### and human waste are often to blame as well. In the 1960s and '70s,
### the eutrophication of Lake Erie advanced so extremely that it
### became known as the “dead lake.” And many areas of the oceans
### worldwide—some more than 20,000 square miles in extent—have
### become “dead zones,” where almost no life of any kind exists.

## Words from Mythology and History
### aeolian harp
### A box-shaped instrument with
### strings that produce musical sounds when the wind blows on them.
### • Poets have long been fascinated by the aeolian harp, the only
### instrument that produces music without a human performer.
### According to the ancient Greeks, Aeolus was the king or guardian of
### the winds. He lived in a cave with his many, many sons and
### daughters, and sent forth whatever wind Zeus asked for. When
### Odysseus stopped there on his way home from Troy, he received a
### bag of winds to fill his sails. But while he was asleep, his men,
### thinking it contained treasure, opened the bag and released the
### raging winds, which blew their ships all the way back to their
### starting point. An aeolian harp produces enchanting harmonies when
### the wind passes over it. According to Homer, it was the god Hermes
### who invented the harp, by having the wind blow over the dried
### sinews attached to the shell of a dead tortoise.

### cynosure
### (1) A guide. (2) A center of attention.
### • Near the club's dance floor, a young rock star was hanging out, the
### cynosure of a small crowd of admirers.
### In Greek kynosoura means “dog's tail,” and in Latin Cynosura came
### to mean the constellation Ursa Minor (Little Bear)—what we usually
### call the Little Dipper. The first star on the dog's or bear's “tail,” or the
### dipper's “handle,” is Polaris, the North Star, long used as a guide for
### seamen or travelers lost on a clear night, since, unlike the other
### stars, it always remains in the same position in the northern sky,
### while the other constellations (and even the rest of its own
### constellation) slowly revolve around it. Since Cynosura also came to
### mean the star itself, the English cynosure now may mean both
### “guide” and “center of attention.”

### laconic
### Using extremely few words.
### • Action-film scripts usually seem to call for laconic leading men who
### avoid conversation but get the job done.
### Ancient Sparta was located in the region of Greece known as
### Laconia, and the Greek word lakonikos could mean both “Laconian”
### and “Spartan.” The disciplined and militaristic Spartans, the finest
### warriors of their time, were known for putting up with extreme
### conditions without complaint. So English writers who knew their
### ancient history came to use laconic to describe the habit of saying
### few words. Today we can refer not only to a laconic person but also
### to laconic wit, a laconic answer, or a laconic phrase—such as “Men of
### few words require few laws,” uttered by a Spartan king.

### mnemonic
### Having to do with the memory; assisting
### the memory.
### • Sales-training courses recommend various mnemonic devices as a
### way of remembering peoples' names.
### The Greek word for memory is mnemosyne, and Mnemosyne was
### the goddess of memory and the mother of the Muses. So something
### that helps the memory is a mnemonic aid, or simply a mnemonic.
### Such traditional mnemonic devices as “Every Good Boy Does Fine”
### (for the notes on the lines of a musical staff with a treble clef) or the
### “Thirty days hath September” rhyme help to recall simple rules or
### complicated series that might otherwise slip away. (For extra credit,
### guess what “King Henry Died Drinking Chocolate Milk” or “King Philip
### Could Only Find Green Socks” stands for.) Notice that the first m isn't
### pronounced, unlike in other -mne- words such as amnesia and
### amnesty.

### platonic
### (1) Relating to the philosopher Plato or his
### teachings. (2) Involving a close relationship from which romance and
### sex are absent.
### • The male and female leads in sitcoms often keep their relationship
### platonic for the first few seasons, but romance almost always wins
### out in the end.
### The philosopher Plato presented his theories in a series of dramatic
### conversations between Socrates and other people, now called the
### “Platonic dialogues.” Among many other important concepts, he
### taught that everything here on earth is a pale imitation—like a
### shadow—of its ideal form, and this ideal form is now often called the
### “platonic form.” But platonic is probably usually seen in the phrase
### “platonic love.” Because Socrates (through Plato) teaches that the
### philosophical person should turn his passion for a lover into
### appreciation of beauty and love of a higher power and of the
### universe, close but nonsexual friendship between two people who
### might be thought to be romantically attracted is today known as
### platonic love or friendship.

### sapphic
### (1) Lesbian. (2) Relating to a poetic verse pattern
### associated with Sappho.
### • The Roman poets Catullus and Horace composed wonderful love
### poems in sapphic verse.
### The poet Sappho wrote poems of self-reflection but also of passion,
### some of it directed to the women attending the school she
### conducted on the Greek island of Lesbos around 600 B.C. Even
### though most of the poems survive only as fragments, they have
### been greatly admired for many centuries. They were written in an
### original rhythmical pattern, which has become known as sapphic
### verse. Later admirers, such as the Roman poets Catullus and Horace,
### honored her by adopting the sapphic meter for their own poetry.
### Because of Sappho, the island of Lesbos also gave its name to
### lesbianism, which writers often used to call sapphic love.

### Socratic
### Having to do with the philosopher Socrates or
### with his teaching method, in which he systematically questioned the
### student in conversation in order to draw forth truths.
### • She challenges her students by using the Socratic method,
### requiring them to think and respond constantly in every class.
### Socrates lived and taught in Athens in the 5th century B.C., but left
### no writings behind, so all we know of him comes through the works
### of his disciple Plato, almost all of which claim to be accounts of
### Socrates' conversations with others. Today Socrates is best
### remembered for his method of teaching by asking increasingly
### difficult questions, the so-called Socratic method. This generally
### involves the use of Socratic induction, a way of gradually arriving at
### generalizations through a process of questions and answers, and
### Socratic irony, in which the teacher pretends ignorance while
### questioning his students skillfully to make them aware of their errors
### in understanding.

### solecism
### (1) A grammatical mistake in speaking or
### writing. (2) A blunder in etiquette or proper behavior.
### • The poor boy committed his first solecism immediately on entering
### by tracking mud over the Persian rug in the dining room.
### In ancient Asia Minor (now Turkey), there was a city called Soloi
### where the inhabitants spoke Greek that was full of grammatical
### errors. So errors in grammar, and later also small errors in formal
### social behavior, came to be known (at least by intellectuals) as
### solecisms. The British magazine The Economist publishes a list of
### solecisms to be avoided in its prose, including the use of “try and”
### when you mean “try to,” “hone in on” when you mean “home in on,”
### and so forth. Social solecisms, such as mentioning how inferior the
### wine is to someone who turns out to be the hostess's sister, are
### more commonly called by a French name, faux pas.
